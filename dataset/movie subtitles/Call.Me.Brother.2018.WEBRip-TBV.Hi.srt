00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:03,616
(triumphant music)

2
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:13,690
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:31,943
(alarm beeping)

4
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,527
(upbeat music)

5
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:01,905
Tony, wake up.

6
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:08,545
(laughs)

7
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,903
(upbeat music)

8
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:14,994
(laughs)

9
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:17,578
(upbeat music)

10
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,745
[Doris] Breakfast is ready.

11
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,579
Coming.

12
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,162
(upbeat music)

13
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,603
(telephone ringing)

14
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:37,973
(peaceful music)

15
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,469
(telephone ringing)

16
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,220
(peaceful music)

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,002
(telephone ringing)

18
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:48,077
(car engine roaring)

19
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,806
(beep)

20
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,623
[Lisa] Hey Tony, it's Lisa.

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,662
You remember me?

22
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,259
(laughs) Just kidding.

23
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,589
I'm gonna be there early in
the morning tomorrow, so, yeah.

24
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,093
I can't believe it's been 10 years.

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
It's crazy.

26
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,873
I can't wait to see you.

27
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,039
I don't really know why I'm calling,

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,519
but just wanna let you know.

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,639
Okay, I'll see you soon, bye.

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,549
(upbeat music)

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,579
[Rachel] Do you have your tooth brush?

32
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,413
[Lisa] Yeah.

33
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:20,260
[Rachel] Don't let your dad feed you

34
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:21,329
whatever he wants, okay?

35
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,163
Yeah.

36
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:24,219
[Rachel] Don't call so
much, I know you like to call.

37
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,210
[Lisa] Sure.

38
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,379
I'm gonna be there early on Sunday,

39
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,179
so do not make me wait, okay?

40
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,013
I got it.

41
00:02:29,013 --> 00:02:29,903
Excuse me?

42
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:30,830
I got it.

43
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,405
Don't talk to me like that.

44
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,239
What?

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,159
Don't, yes, I'm sorry, I got it.

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,993
Okay, I love you.

47
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:36,907
I know.

48
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,199
(upbeat music)

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,409
Give your brother a
big squeeze for me, okay?

50
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,889
Wait, you're not gonna come in?

51
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,679
No, goddammit Lisa, I've gotta catch

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,559
a fucking flight, okay?

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Shit.

54
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,079
Go, I gotta get off, did you hear me?

55
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,989
Yes, see.

56
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,373
Get out, I gotta go.

57
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,092
(bag thudding)

58
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:54,925
Now look.

59
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,609
Goddammit Lisa, we just got that.

60
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,519
It is grandma's.

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,565
Love you.

62
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,623
(car engine revving)

63
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,207
(bag dragging)

64
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:12,610
(door bell ringing)

65
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,669
(spoon stirring)

66
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,599
Lisa, I'm so glad to finally meet you.

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,709
Yeah.

68
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,069
I'm really excited about us
getting to know each other.

69
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,343
Your dad tells me all
sorts of things about you.

70
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:25,599
(laughs)

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,709
And of course I know
about you already mister.

72
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,713
I wash your sheets.

73
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,890
That's my boy.

74
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,339
Oh, I hope you don't
mind sharing a room.

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,109
For God's sakes, you kids
used to bathe together.

76
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,179
[Tony] Yeah, that was fun.

77
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,349
We're making the spare room,

78
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,569
into a beautiful sitting room.

79
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,410
For sitting?

80
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,410
Yes.

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,039
What else?

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,144
That's it.

83
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,254
That's it?

84
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:54,599
Yes (laughs)

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,479
Lisa, I know this is new for you,

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,719
but I want you to know,
Doris is here to stay.

87
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,184
You're gonna fall in love
with her, just like I have.

88
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:02,499
Aaw.

89
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,894
Doris actually cooks.

90
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,589
(laughs)

91
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,184
How did you guys meet?

92
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:08,018
(chuckles)

93
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,869
Well, I was at a gas station...

94
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,626
Your mother had just
sent me divorce papers.

95
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,139
And I saw this pathetic looking man,

96
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,666
just leaning on the counter.

97
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,500
That was me.

98
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,176
And I leaned in and I said,

99
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,329
- "I like your look." (laughs)
- "I like your look."

100
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,359
She took me to a hotel.

101
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,839
[Doris] We drank and drank.

102
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,379
And she talked me through everything.

103
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,719
I had just finished an
online course, in psychology.

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,059
Finally felt like I
could let everything out,

105
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,529
without feeling judged.

106
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,580
And we've been going strong ever since.

107
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,191
She's the one kids.

108
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,151
Wow, well, I'm happy for you guys.

109
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:41,235
(laughs)

110
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,849
Oh honey, I'm running so late.

111
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,850
Oh.

112
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,519
Anything?

113
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,869
Sharp as a rock.

114
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,410
Now I've got a rock for you (mumbles)

115
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:55,078
(both giggling)

116
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,869
Bye dad.

117
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,870
It's Frank.

118
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:00,952
(gobbles)

119
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:03,619
(feet stomping)

120
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:05,539
(shrugs)

121
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,289
(peaceful music)

122
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,656
(sprinkler sputtering)

123
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:51,927
(peaceful music)

124
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:08,322
(air whooshing)

125
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,656
(crunching)

126
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:15,078
(trash bumping)

127
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,245
(gasping)

128
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,033
Goddammit, don't,

129
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:20,239
that's...
- It's all about

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,959
the follow through.

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,279
You sound just like Katie.

132
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,194
Oh yeah?

133
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,120
- Yeah.
- She wasn't saying

134
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:28,259
that last night, when I was, oh, oh yeah.

135
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,327
- That is my girlfriend,
- Oh you like that?

136
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,161
Asshole.

137
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:31,419
- Uh, you like this dick?
- Okay, you know she wouldn't

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,789
do that, she's a good
girl, she's fucking good.

139
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,569
She wouldn't suck that trashy-ass of dick.

140
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,403
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

141
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:38,739
You're saying that now,

142
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,899
but she recycled my cum last night.

143
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,385
(bumps)
- What the fuck?

144
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,009
(door bell ringing)

145
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,810
Hello, welcome to Speedway Market.

146
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:52,299
Don't touch my dick, touch your dick.

147
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,715
It's in there.

148
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:55,336
(laughs)

149
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:58,989
You know, they say,
raisins are an aphrodisiac.

150
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,479
They do?

151
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,393
No.

152
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:03,049
(laughs)

153
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,706
Chocolate is, though.

154
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,558
(sighs) I hate chocolate.

155
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,392
Oh.

156
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,975
(gentle music)

157
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,929
Remember that time we broke
into mom's Halloween candy,

158
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,458
and she made you eat the whole bag?

159
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,459
Yeah.

160
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,910
Yeah, that was funny.

161
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,290
Thanks.

162
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:33,365
(drink squirting)

163
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,169
Oh ah, got a little something.

164
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,536
What is it?

165
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:46,537
I think it's just bike grease, got it.

166
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,450
Thanks.

167
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,963
Anything for the pretty lady.

168
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,860
(peaceful music)

169
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,713
Hi.

170
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:04,713
Hey.

171
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:08,099
(papers rustling)

172
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,350
That's $7.85.

173
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,433
Keep the change.

174
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,620
I can't, it messes up the drawer.

175
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,930
Just keep it.

176
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,050
But it messes up the drawer.

177
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,830
(peaceful music)

178
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,171
Okay.

179
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,894
(paper rustling)

180
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,217
(shoes click-clacking)

181
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,729
(door alarm beeping)

182
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,419
I could have used that.

183
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,309
What the fuck, it's just
$2, what's the big deal?

184
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

185
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,209
Katie only takes cash (laughs)

186
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,599
Oh yeah, like you gonna
(mumbles)

187
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Get upset?

188
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,397
(laughs)

189

(both grunting)

190
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,033
Don't fall.

191
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,039
Stop, that's cheating.

192
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,391
Don't fall.

[Lisa] Hey.

197
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:13,699
[Tony] What?

198
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,623
Chicken butt.

199
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:16,239
(snorts)

200
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,529
Nice.

202
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,590
Mom said hi.

203
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,850
Hi.

204
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,483
You should tell her that.

205
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:31,649
I would, if I even knew
what she looked like anymore.

206
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,004
Oh, come on.

207
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,229

208
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,039
(chess piece clicking)

209
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,970
Checkmate.

210
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:41,590
That's not what that means (laughs)

211
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,174
I wish you'd visit.

212
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:47,589
(peaceful music)

213
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,590
You look different.

214
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:51,136
What?

215
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:52,889
I don't know.

216
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,697
Could it be my charming good looks?

217
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:58,759
Or my sensitive eyes?

218
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,139
Or my ability to chug a 44?

219
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,140
Do it.

220
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:05,589
(laughs)
(slurping)

221
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,319
Oh no, you're not gonna...

222
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
No you can't.

[Woman] Driving in the
(mumbles) road together, is great.

228
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,659
But I think women would agree,

229
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,119
getting home to cuddle up
with their men, is nice too.

230
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,619
But here's the thing,
about half of men over 40,

231
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,279
have some degree of erectile dysfunction.

232
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,359
[Man] Ask your doctor if your heart

233
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,833
is healthy enough for sex.

234
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:46,939
Do you want to take Viagra,

235
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,199

Yeah, it's fun having a roomie.

you can't have sex with.

324
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,930
Yeah.

325
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,579
Hey, it's really important to me,

326
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,629
that you and Doris get along.

327
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,249
She's new to the whole stepmom thing.

328
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,829
Yeah, of course, she seems nice.

329
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,830

334
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,719
Why?

335

337
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,599
No, I mean dad.

338

Oh.

339
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,299

weird when you guys say it.

340
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300

[Frank] Oh, God, I do not
need this bullshit again.

379
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,134
[Rachel] Whenever you fucking flirt

380
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,049
in front of me all the time,

381
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,968
I know what you do when
you're by yourself.

382
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:35,096
[Frank] Oh you know what?

383
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:37,332
Hey, there's something on your face.

384
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,166
(spraying)

385
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:38,999
(shouting)

386
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,969
(laughs)

387
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,679
[Tony] You're gonna ruin the cupcakes.

388
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,735
No.

389
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:45,877
(metal dish clanking)

390
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,961
(laughs)

391
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,670
[Rachel] What are you guys doing?

392
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,733
Nothing.

393
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,839
Clean yourselves up for God's sake,

394
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,700
and get ready for dinner,

395
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,359
and do not expect dessert.

396
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,369
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,779
[Rachel] Don't call me ma'am.

398
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,613
Yes mommy.

399
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,759
(shoes thumping)

400
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,889
[Rachel] Oh, crazy, let's do that.

401
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,549
Let's do that, call me crazy.
- [Frank] Yeah.

402
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,414
You know what, you're crazy.
- Hey.

403
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,280
You're sweet.
- [Rachel] Don't call

404
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,113
me crazy.

405
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:11,348
[Frank] Great, you're insane.

406
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:13,432

407
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,727

So, you look nice, what
are you up to today?

423
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,973
Just going to Tony's friend's house.

424
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:02,053

428
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,811
Sometimes, I eat to fill a void.

429
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,033
You ever do that?

430
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,159
Maybe.

431
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I like it, the way it feels
when my tummy gets hard.

433
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,903
Yeah?

00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:25,803
Yeah, it's filling.

435
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,163
Yeah, I know what you mean.

436
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,079
Your dad really likes you here.

437
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,859
And Tony, I know loves it.

438
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,360
Yeah, well, I miss them too.

439
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,883
You should move in with
us, your junior year.

440
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:49,378
Oh I would, but that would
mean my mom would be alone,

441
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,433
and I should just visit more.

442
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,823
I know she doesn't make it easy.

443
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,529
She's just going through a lot of stuff.

444
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,286
Yeah, well.

445
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,149
But you're great.

446
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,779
I mean, I know I just met you,
but Frank seems really happy.

447
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,879
I love making him happy.

448
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
That's great.

449
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,999
My mom would hate, if she
saw what I've been eating.

450
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,105
Well eat up honey, men
love something to grab onto.

454
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,473

Hi.

474
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,999
Hey, will you come
to the kitchen with me?

475
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,149
Why?

476
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,943
I have a question about
the look of the chicken?

477
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:44,083
Ask Chad, he's the one
who goes to culinary school.

478
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:47,785
(lips smacking)

479
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,469
He's busy, let's go, come on.

480
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,693
Come on, follow me, follow me.

481
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:58,271
(lips smacking)

482
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,003

483
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,279
(exhales)

484
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,529
Pretend you're looking at the chicken.

485
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,460
Why?

486
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:09,929
(metal clanking)

487
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,149
What the hell, man?

488
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,439
What's the deal with
you, and that Hottie,

489
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,400
glazed in a sweet layer of
polyester and insecurity?

490
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:20,173
Oh, come on.

491
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:22,089
Well, are you gonna?

492
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,926
No, that's my sister.

493
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:26,269
(gasping)

494
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,469
Wait, that's Lisa?

495
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,719
Yeah.

496
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,885
Oh, man and she's
your half sister, right?

497
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:38,225
No, she's my full sister.

498
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:40,309
(laughs)

499
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,156

500
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:44,082

502
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:47,269
What are you doing?

503
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,209
I went down on my cousin
once at Thanksgiving,

504
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,379
not like under the table,
but it was in my mimi's room,

505
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,422
and it's hard to tell the difference

506
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:57,173
between the common meat
and the others, you know?

507
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
No.

508
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:06,649
(exhales)

509
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,650
Hey Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad,
Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad.

510
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,689
What's your deal, fuck brain?

511
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,683
Hey, don't... ladies, don't fight.

512
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,899
But do, but don't, but
if you do, use a banana.

513
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,603
Get me a plantain, I want it to hurt.

514
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,623
So, what do you think of the chicken?

515
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,345
I don't think it's chicken.

516
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:35,324
(exhales)

517
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:36,824
That's what I was afraid of.

518
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:45,128
(air whooshing)

519
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,959
Didn't know you smoked.

520
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,793
Oh, I don't.

521
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:50,879
- Oh.
- Yeah.

522
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,093
Just pretend, look.

523
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,219
Oh.

524
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,653
Yeah, kind of just makes me feel cool.

525
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,769
Can I try?

526
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,770
Yeah.

527
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,132
(puffs)

528
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,406
(coughs)

529
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:14,572
Jeez hold on you vacuum
mouth, it's not a doobie.

530
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:15,406
(laughs)

531
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:17,184
I don't know if I like that.

532
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:18,811
(laughs)

533
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,378
Yeah, me neither.

534
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:22,615
(grass rustling)

535
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:23,449
(gasping)

536
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:24,449
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

537
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,749
(laughs)

538
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,603
What you doing little squirrel?

539
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,833
I bet we could both
fit into this jacket.

540
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:43,720
(panting)

541
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:48,027
- Oh.
- Ah.

542
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,789
(metal clanking)

543
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,399
This is how I want to
spend the rest of my days.

544
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,369
Driving down the street,
listening to the radio

545
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,543
in my cool car, and
looking at pretty girls.

546
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,708
You're fucking loser.

547
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:09,069
(upbeat music)

548
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,330
Daddy's home, you stupid fucks.

549
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:13,914
(upbeat music)

550
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,750
Hey.

551
00:26:17,581 --> 00:26:18,581
Oh, I'm sorry.

552
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:24,393
Couple of losers in a sausage pack.

553
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,269
Dude, dude.

554
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,069
Ladies, diss this scrub,
and get with the man,

555
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,889
the King, the father, Mercedes (laughs)

556
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,839
Why are you guys even here?

557
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,019
Better question, why
are you guys even alive?

558
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,716
Oh, I forgot to say
hi to my buddy, Brian.

559
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:44,765
No, shit.

560
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,599
(body thudding)

561
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,682
(laughs)

562
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:53,489
(groaning)

563
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,062
You put something on me?

564
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:56,389
(laughs)

565
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,293
Lisa, don't pee.

566
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:00,197
I win.

567
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:02,710
You cheat.

568
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:04,794
(laughs)

569
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,761
You little bitch, you like that Brian?

570
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:10,806
Huh?

571
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:12,716
Tap out, bitch, tap out.

572
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:13,870
(groans)

573
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:14,704
(laughs)

574
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:15,994
Yeah, you like that bitch?

575
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:17,999
(laughs)

576
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,369
Oh, what's up, losers?

577
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,639
You can't just come in here.

578
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,440
We can do whatever we want, fatty.

579
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,469
'Cause I'm fucking your sister,

580
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,049
I can come into the house,
and I can cum into the house.

581
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,883
Yeah.

582
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:30,883
Give it up.

583
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,749
Boing boing, hey
girl, you like hot dogs?

584
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,049
Dude, that's my sister.

585
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,020
(laughs)

586
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,620
I like extra Mayo, and chili on mine.

587
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:40,653
Gross.

588
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,889
Sorry, we didn't introduce ourselves.

589
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,859
My name's Bleach, this is Mercedes.

590
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,693
Kiss, kiss.

591
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:47,526
(lips smacking)

592
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:49,669
Whatever, your name's Jason and Mark.

593
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,484
Two of the most generic ass
fucking names on the planet.

594
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:54,468
(giggles)

595
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:56,617
What the fuck did you just say to me?

596
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:57,493
(lollipop thunking)

597
00:27:57,494 --> 00:27:58,859
Oh my God.

598
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,755
I got it.

599
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:01,267
I got it, I got it.
- Get it out, get it out,

600
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:02,849
it's in my head, get it out.
- I got it, I got it.

601
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,499
(door lock opening)

602
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,388
Hey, babe.

603
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:08,972
(upbeat music)

604
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,235
Hey babe.

605
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:16,486
(heels click-clacking)

606
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,769
What the fuck is going on in here?

607
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,019
These two tall-ass Mighty Ducks came in,

608
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,439
and ruined our hang.

609
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Where's my snack?

610
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,409
Be cool Brian, it's not
like mom's even gonna be home

611
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,725
for like two days, or whatever.

612
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:35,829
So, why don't you just
shut the fuck up for once?

613
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,589
Whatever, we can go hang in my room.

614
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,433
Wait, who is this little girl?

615
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:42,631
[Tony] This is my sister, she's...

616
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:44,489
Wow, is she fucking asking you, bro?

617
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,259
No, go ahead babe.

618
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,669
Let me guess, you're his sister,

619
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,599
and you're visiting for the weekend.

620
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,099
And you're feeling really displaced,

621
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,207
because you don't know anybody here,

622
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,889
which is making you really uncomfortable.

623
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,483
And now you're starting to miss mommy.

624
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,190
Kinda.

625
00:29:03,947 --> 00:29:06,030
(laughs)

626
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,773
That sucks.

627
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,119
Hey, you wanna leave?

628
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Yeah.

629
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:19,049
Hey guys, we're gonna bounce.

630
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,329
Dammit, Sydney, you
ruin fucking everything.

631
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,619
Kate's paid, slut.

632
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,927
Excuse me.

633
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:27,789
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

634
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,931
(body thudding)

635
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:31,015
(laughs)

636
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:35,841
(upbeat music)

637
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:56,566
♪ I ought to be safe ♪

638
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,813
♪ I probably shouldn't try ♪

639
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:06,243
I miss this place.

640
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,130
Miss the crew?

641
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,373
(laughs) No.

642
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,080
You ever notice how
playgrounds, smell like blood?

643
00:30:18,577 --> 00:30:20,483
Yeah, kind of do.

644
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,379
Are you grossed out by blood?

645
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,206
Yeah, I guess so.

646
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:28,286
I think it'd be weird,
if I said I loved blood.

647
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,297
(laughs)

648
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:30,993
Yeah, yeah.

649
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,323
You think you'd ever be
grossed out by my blood?

650
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,026
No, your blood's my blood.

651
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:45,777
(birds chirping)

652
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,996
(cutlery clanking)

653
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,959
So, how was your day?

654
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Good.

655
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:01,849
Just hanging out with some friends.

656
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,750
Which friends?

657
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,969
- Just Brian, and Ched,
- Oh.

658
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,069
And his weird lizard girls.

659
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,569
I love lizards.

660
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,820
Of course you do, baby.

661
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:12,269
(laughs)

662
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,143
So, Lisa what'd you
think of Brian and Ched?

663
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,630
They're fine.

664
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,410
You can say it.

665
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,689
Say what?

666
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,659
They're fucking losers.

667
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,699
[Doris] Frank.

668
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,653
I'm just kidding (laughs)

669
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:27,654
No.

670
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,709
You're a fucking loser, dad.

671
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,710
Excuse me?

672
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,283
I'm just kidding.

673
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:36,361
(hands clapping)

674
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:37,220
(laughs)

675
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:39,529
Lisa, do you miss home?

676
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,919
No, not really.

677
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Good.

678
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,919
Good.

679
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,499
That's why, I think
it'd be fun if you just

680
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,999
moved in with us your junior year.

681
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,899
Yeah, I mean, it'd be cool.

682
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,249
You know, living with mom sucks,

683
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,070
and living with us would be...

684
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,493
I mean, Doris cooks great
food, and you're cool.

685
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,713
Thank you.

686
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,859
Yeah, maybe.

687
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,089
I think it's an interesting idea.

688
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,769
I mean, as long as you're
able to handle my jokes,

689
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,149
and share your tampons
with your brother here,

690
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,969
every once in a while.

691
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,905
[Doris] Frank.

692
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,988
(laughs)

693
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,277
I don't even use tampons.

694
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,323
Oh honey.

695
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,984
I just free bleed.

696
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:34,818
Eew.

697
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,568
(spoon clanking)

698
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,519
I'm just kidding.

699
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,643
[Frank] Not very funny.

700
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,839
So, this is creative mode.

701
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,469
So you just go around, build houses,

702
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,983
tend to your chickens, cows.

703
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,913
Here check this out,
you see all these dogs?

704
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:02,999
Yeah.

705
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,848
You can hit 'em.

706
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,329
(dog squeaking)

707
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,366
- Yeah.
- But...

708
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:08,094
But you see I have so many?

709
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:09,275
Yeah.

710
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:10,288
Yeah.

711
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,489
(dogs squeaking)

712
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,773
Jesus, where'd they go?

713
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,808
I killed them.

714
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:15,896
Oh.

715
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:18,385
No, no, it's not real, look.

716
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,219
(dogs squeaking)

717
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,659
What are you doing?

718
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,469
I thought that would make it better.

719
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,673
Jesus, I'm sorry.

720
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,206
I'm sorry, I didn't know you'd
feel so passionate about it.

721
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,207
It's fine.

722
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,520
Look, they're all back.

723
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,720
Better?

724
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Yeah.

725
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:43,915
I have too many fucking dogs.

726
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:44,749
Good.

727
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,832
(laughs)

728
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,737
I need to go to bed, right now.

729
00:33:57,543 --> 00:33:58,829
Okay, well...

730
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,580
(metal clanking)

731
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:03,796
Good night.

732
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:10,325
(light switch clicking)

733
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:22,695
(peaceful music)

734
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,317
[Rachel] Fuck you.

735
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,488
[Frank] Oh, real nice, fuck you.

736
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,322
[Rachel] Fuck you.

737
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:33,228
[Frank] Oh, way to go
drama queen, fuck you.

738
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,071
[Tony] I'm coming to get you.

739
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,508
[Lisa] You'll never catch me.

740
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:37,390
[Frank] Fuck you.

741
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,153
[Rachel] Oh yeah, whatever, fuck you.

742
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:40,452
[Frank] Fuck you.

743
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,827
[Rachel] Fuck you,
(mumbles) like me there.

744
00:34:42,828 --> 00:34:43,868
[Frank] Well, we couldn't like you,

745
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:46,387
so if maybe you were a
little more fucking likeable.

746
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:47,760
Yeah, figure out how to be a wife first,

747
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:49,949
then maybe figure out ho to be a mother.

748
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,640
I win, I win, I win, I win, I win.

749
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,142
Yay.

750
00:34:53,143 --> 00:34:54,560
Tony, my prize.

751
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,089
[Rachel] I'm only a
mess 'cause you're here.

752
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,239
[Frank] No, I'm not
the reason you're a mess,

753
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,124
you're the reason that
you are a fucking mess.

754
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,045
[Rachel] This life is
a mess, I'm sick of this,

755
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,459
whatever, man.

756
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,239
[Frank] Well, I'm sick of
this, so much more than you are.

757
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,859
You cannot be half as sick of it as I am.

758
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,645
[Rachel] Whatever, I'm done
with this, I'm go through.

759
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:15,590
(door lock opening)

760
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:17,341
[Rachel] What do you think you're doing?

761
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:18,799
(palm smacking)

762
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,989
[Tony] Ah, I...

763
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,509
[Rachel] You're not thinking,
that's what you're doing.

764
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,389
[Frank] Rachel, eave him alone.

765
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,421
[Rachel] You're just like him.

766
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:27,855

768
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,420
[Frank] Don't pick it out on the boy,

769
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:32,545
pick it out on me.
- Hey Tony.

770
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,843
Race to the street, whoever
wins, gets all my candy.

771
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:36,227
Oh, it's on.

772
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:37,585
[Frank] Anything any more.

773
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:39,814
[Rachel] I'm barely
able to get out of bed,

774
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:40,923

775
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:44,348

Oh, hey Frank, how's the sitting?

817
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,689
It hurts, my but is
not made for sitting.

818
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,893
It's made for standing,
and looking pretty.

819
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,250
Yeah.

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,693

This is nice, it's like you
have your own little getaway.

823
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,623
Well, to be honest,

824
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,529
it's not really going
to be a sitting room.

825
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,393
I'm gonna turn it into a
secret cooking room, for Doris.

826
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,959
Shouldn't that be in the kitchen?

827
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,549
No, no, I'm gonna redo the whole room,

828
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,979
put a kitchen in it.

829
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,079
Put a bunch of cutting
board space over there,

830
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,330
I'll have a vent that
goes up to the ceiling.

831
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,439
She can have her gals over whenever wants,

832
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,833
they can take up as
much space as they want.

833
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,979
So, it'll be like a
little getaway kitchen.

834
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
Exactly.

835
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,870
You must really love her.

836
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,169
All her words aren't my favorite words,

837
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,505
but yeah, I really do love her.

00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,469
Yeah, It's just Brian has a...

874

It's a party, Doris.

[Doris] Ooh a party, Lisa,
you wanna borrow a dress later?

876
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,229
They're all tight, the boys love tight.

877
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,349
Isn't that right son?

878
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,453
Yeah, we like tight.

879
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,326

00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:12,597
You okay, honey?

883
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,419
[Doris] Yeah, just slippery hands.

884
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,289
Well, don't dry those hands off.

885
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,359
[Doris] What?

886
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,439
Oh, come on, you shut
up now you dirty man.

887
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,009
Doris, do you want any help?

888
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,083
[Doris] I got it, thanks sweetie.

889
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,909
Now look at that kids, a pretty woman

890
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,323
looking sexy every day.

891
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,789
My sweet, precious fruit of my loins,

892
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,513
this is it, this is the life.

893
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,483
To find someone who makes
you, like this peach.

894
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,809
To find someone who's
soft, and ready to burst,

895
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,293
and when they burst, you don't
mind getting a little messy.

896
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,579

897
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,127

898
00:41:59,128 --> 00:41:59,961
What?

899
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:02,019
I'm teaching my kids something.

900
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,879
Life lessons, sharing something special.

901
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,102
Don't listen to him, he's
just a dirty little horn dog.

902
00:42:08,103 --> 00:42:10,129
(laughs)

903
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,058
Frank, you can't just
talk to them like that.

904
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:12,892
[Frank] What?

905
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:13,725
They get it.

906
00:42:13,725 --> 00:42:14,558
(laughs)

907
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,439
I do agree, a love like this is special.

908
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,469
I mean, everyone deserves it.

909
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,889
It can be hard, but...

910
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,770
You know what helps?

911
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:23,794
Is that dresses.

912
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:25,309
(laughs)

913
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,533
Are you sure you don't wanna
borrow something sweetie?

914
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,279
I feel comfortable in this.

915
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,409
She doesn't need tight
dresses to look pretty.

916
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,143
She's already perfectly
wrapped in her own skin.

917
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,819
(laughs)

918
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,140
That is a scary pickup line son (laughs)

919
00:42:47,141 --> 00:42:48,058
Can we go?

920
00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:49,058
Yeah.

921
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,039
Doris, what are you
putting in these potatoes?

922
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,463
These are unreal.

00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,239
Yeah, in just a second.

928
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,793
You look fine, you look very pretty.

929
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,593
I don't really feel pretty today.

930
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,310
Hang on.

931
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:31,145
(shoes stomping)

932
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:33,936
(door opening)

933
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:36,854
(papers rustling)

934
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,084
(door clicking shut)

935
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,150
Here.

936
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:48,729
(gasping)

937
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,730
Good?

938
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:51,686
Yes.

939
00:43:51,687 --> 00:43:53,489
Okay, I have more.

940
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,400
Yeah?

941
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:59,113
Yeah, but you have to keep
wearing this, if you want more.

942
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Okay, fine.

943
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:08,059
Cool, I'll be downstairs, okay?

944
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,913
Same you, same candy, yeah?

945
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:12,204
Yeah.

946
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:13,204
[Tony] Okay, cool.

947
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:19,345
(door opening)

948
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:23,599
(door clicking shut)

949
00:44:31,306 --> 00:44:34,556
(shoes click clacking)

950
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:38,497
(door knocking)

951
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:41,409
(door squeaking open)

952
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,410
Frank?

953
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,163
Oh, hey Tony.

954
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,230
What's up?

955
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,500
Just sitting.

956
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,969
Isn't that what the sitting room's for?

957
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,433
Hurts my butt to sit on
the ground all the time.

958
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:02,707
Oh.

959
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,766
(hand slapping)

960
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:08,017
(shoes click clacking)

961
00:45:16,537 --> 00:45:17,752
(hand slapping)

962
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:22,423
I don't think I've ever
talked with you about man stuff.

963
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,693
No need, I got it.

964
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,483
Well, my best advice to you,

965
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,153
is to always tell the person
you love, what you do.

966
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,100
That's good advice.

967
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,609
Yeah, men aren't always hard.

968
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,119
I've never had a problem in that way,

969
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,939
and your blood is my blood, so...

970
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,940
Yeah, I got it.

971
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:52,389
Do you mind doing me a favor son?

972
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,919
Sure.

973
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,676
Today is a special day for Doris.

974
00:45:56,677 --> 00:45:58,269
Oh, is it her birthday?

975
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,509
Oh, I have no idea when that is.

976
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,039
I bought her a bunch of new cooking books,

977
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,109
and she's gonna go crazy, when
she sees how many I got her.

978
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,160
That's really nice.

979
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,689
Do you think you could set up

980
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,809
the bathroom with some candles?

981
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,889
I'd do it myself, but...

982
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,509
Yeah, sure.

983
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,510
Great.

984
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,729
What's that?

985
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,649
Oh, I missed the Annual
Peach and Music Festival,

986
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,650
this year.

987
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,133
It's just really frustrating.

988
00:46:43,578 --> 00:46:47,070
(peaceful music)

989
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,746
(door clicking shut)

990
00:46:48,747 --> 00:46:51,997
(shoes click clacking)

991
00:46:53,168 --> 00:46:55,751
(door opening)

992
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,739
What are you doing?

993
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,603
Oh, date night for dad.

994
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,450
Cute.

995
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:10,752
(lighter flicking)

996
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:23,189
(lighter flicking)

997
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,357
[Frank] She's our kid,
and this is her home.

998
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:26,339
[Rachel] She's going away.

999
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:27,172
[Frank] She belongs where

1000
00:47:27,173 --> 00:47:28,607
she's loved, Rachel.
- You are no match for us,

1001
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:30,083
I'm Princess Fairy Sparkle.

1002
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:31,775
[Frank] Where do you
think you're gonna go?

1003
00:47:31,776 --> 00:47:33,215
(toys thwacking)

1004
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,366
- He's not going down.
- No, no you cannot take

1005
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:35,360
those kids away from me.

1006
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,280
I said pony.

1007
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,322
- We need new rear
- No, Rachel,

1008
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:38,181
- reinforcements.
- This is not fair,

1009
00:47:38,182 --> 00:47:40,364
you cannot do this.

1010
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:41,300
- Acorn bombs.
- You have no idea

1011
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,133
what you're doing.

1012
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:43,880
Rachel come on, get back here.

1013
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:47,379
This is ridiculous.
- Boom.

1014
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,859
He's still not down.

1015
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,609
(toys thwacking)

1016
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,619
[Rachel] Come on Lisa, let's go,

1017
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,993
right now, lets go come on.

1018
00:47:53,994 --> 00:47:54,827
[Lisa] Tony.

1019
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:56,319
(shoes stomping)

1020
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,677
[Rachel] Come on.

1021
00:47:57,678 --> 00:47:58,765
[Lisa] Tony.

1022
00:47:58,766 --> 00:48:00,341
(car door opening)

1023
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:01,316
(car door slamming shut)

1024
00:48:01,317 --> 00:48:04,399
(car engine revving)

1025
00:48:08,283 --> 00:48:11,033
(birds chirping)

1026
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:13,758
We need to go.

1027
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:20,651
(upbeat music)

1028
00:49:06,664 --> 00:49:09,414
(hands slapping)

1029
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:16,890
Good job.

1030
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,037
(paper rustling)

1031
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:24,369
(hand slapping)

1032
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,439
What's up man?

1033
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,739
Ched failed his
culinary training program.

1034
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,479
Oh, dude.

1035
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,832
And his two golf girls, dumped him.

1036
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:33,833
Oh no.

1037
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,789
I wanna get fucked up tonight.

1038
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:37,623
Sure.

1039
00:49:37,623 --> 00:49:38,456
Hey, shut the fuck up, Brian,

1040
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:39,289
fuck you.
- What did I say?

1041
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:40,122
What the fuck did I say?

1042
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:42,559
Hey did you guys get
invited to that party tonight?

1043
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,239
You got invited to a party?

1044
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,153
Yeah, from some chick
named, Magnificent Pleasure.

1045
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,761
What?

1046
00:49:50,762 --> 00:49:52,762
Lets see, man, lets see.

1047
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,639
Fuck.

1048
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,113
[Ched] Yeah, I'd pin
that down real nice.

1049
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,009
She looks nice.

1050
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,649
Oh, of course she does, she
wants a penis inside of her.

1051
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,483
Do you wanna go?

1052
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:06,429
No, I don't wanna go
if that bitch is going.

1053
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,749
What the fuck is going on in here?

1054
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,489
What are you guys looking at?

1055
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:11,350
No, nothing.

1056
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,243
Just saw that party invite.

1057
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,749
So, are you guys coming?

1058
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,319
Sure.

1059
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,729
I felt bad about the other night.

1060
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,119
I just wanted you guys
to see how cool I am.

1061
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,329
Whatever, you just want me to drive.

1062
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,742
Yeah, pretty much, 'cause I'm
gonna get fucked up tonight.

1063
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:30,799
What if he said he wouldn't drive you?

1064
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,239
Oh, then I would just tell everyone,

1065
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,289
that little Brian never...

1066
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,039
Shut up, Lisa, its nothing.

1067
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,038
Oh, you know what?

1068
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,219
I'm almost forgot to mention,
Charlie's gonna be there.

1069
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,259
Ooh, Charlie's gonna be there.

1070
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,535
Yeah, man would wanna miss out
on that good old D-sucking.

1071
00:50:45,536 --> 00:50:46,709
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1072
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,339
Okay, fine, we'll go, and I'll drive.

1073
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,769
But I don't like one bit of it.

1074
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,043
Except Charlie.

1075
00:50:52,044 --> 00:50:53,509
(upbeat music)

1076
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,532
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1077
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:55,679
[Brian] I will burn
it, I will burn this.

1078
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,550
What are you wearing?

1079
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,383
[Ched] Hey man, hey, hey, hey.

1080
00:50:57,383 --> 00:50:58,216
Quit jerking around.

1081
00:50:58,217 --> 00:51:00,186
Come on, man, you know
he's sensitive about that.

1082
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,853
You are not wearing that.

1083
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,879
What should I wear?

1084
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,199
I think she looks great.

1085
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,090
Oh, are you a girl?

1086
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:08,209
No, sorry.

1087
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,399
Come with me right now.

1088
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,499
[Ched] Just give it back to me.

1089
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,939
Okay, hey, whoa, that's
hey, that's enough.

1090
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,773
That's not enough.

1091
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:15,773
That is enough.

1092
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:19,890
Here you go.

1093
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,940
Pick one.

1094
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,259
It's fine, I mean, I
feel comfortable in this.

1095
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,260
Do it.

1096
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,090
Okay.

1097
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Great.

1098
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,359
Okay, well, I'll be right back.

1099
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,403
No, just change in here.

1100
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:42,350
What?

1101
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,451
Do you have like chest hair, or something?

1102
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
No.

1103
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,850
Okay.

and dad, for the weekend.

Ah, so this is like
your full blood sister.

00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,817
Yeah.

Oh, dirty mommy.

Hey boys, here's a fun fact.

1212
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:49,843
Brian shit his pants, last
time he was at this house.

You really are a little chocolate boy.

Fuck you guy, I just got here.

1216
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,109
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

1217
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,969
Hey, now, now, now who knows?

1218
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,059
He might've had some
laxative with his beer,

1219
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,449
or maybe he just got scared,

1220
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,112
'cause there was too many
pretty ladies running around.

1221
00:57:05,113 --> 00:57:06,911

1222
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:08,842

I wanna come with you.

1226
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:17,860
Hey.

1227
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,860
Yeah?

1228
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,919
I'm hungry.

1229
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,179
Oh, all right, and
that's it for me, boys.

00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,009
Hey, you look stressed.

1234
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,323
Yeah, loosen up.

1235
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,223
Lisa, do you smoke weed?

1236
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,363
Did you get high?

1237
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:51,099
Do you lift this curtain,
that we call life?

1238
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,883
See what's on the other side?

1239
00:57:56,328 --> 00:58:00,187
Yeah, sometimes, but I
don't ever really feel it.

1240
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:03,676
You got to inhale it,
like really inhale it.

1241

1244
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,650
You feel it?

1245
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:16,957
Well, I only felt your tongue.

1246
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:19,041

(gasping)

1250
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:33,949
You really should have
taken your clothes off first.

1251
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,679
I just don't know where
my life is going, okay?

1252
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,679
I'm a fucking loser, nobody respects me,

1253
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,439
you don't like me, you're my best friend,

1254
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,459
and let's be honest, you kinda suck.

1255
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,809
My other best friend's trying
to fuck two bananas out there.

1256
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:52,810
So I am sorry, if I am
having a moment of despair.

1257
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:59,049
Come on, man, I don't suck.

1258
00:58:59,050 --> 00:58:59,990
Really?

1259
00:58:59,991 --> 00:59:04,873
You're cool, you're funny.

1260
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,832
Oh yeah, funny, yeah.

1261
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:09,379
I remember last year, when
you thought it was cool

1262
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,599
and funny, how I shit
my pants, yeah (laughs)

1263
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,339
It was artistic.

1264
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,329
You were brave, you were so brave.

1265
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,449
Yeah, you hear that?

1266
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,569
You're an art guy now, huh?

1267
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,323
Big man on campus, come on,
let's get out of that tub.

1268
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,913
Just leave me here with the water.

1269
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,240
Come on, man.

1270
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,179
Come on Brian, stop it.

1271
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,449
Jesus.

1272
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,833

1278
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:54,363
That's enough for you.

1279
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,909
This feeling, does not feel good.

1280
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,809
It passes (laughs)

1281
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:02,973
Hey, you okay?

1282
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,619
No, where's Tony?

1283
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,403
Relax, he's inside with Charlie (laughs)

1284
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:11,590
They are already fucking by now.

1285

Oh, yeah, oh yeah.

1287
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,410
I doubt it.

1288
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:16,803
Are you thinking he can't get hard?

1289
01:00:16,804 --> 01:00:17,790
(laughs)

1290
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,093
No he can.

1291
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,989
How do you know that?

1292
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,439
I don't know.

1293
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,980
Yeah, how do you know that?

1294
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:31,609
Just (laughs) stop,
whatever you're doing.

1295
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:32,443
What?

1296
01:00:32,444 --> 01:00:35,139
My brother can get hard, okay.

1297
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:39,319
I've seen it, it's
proportional, it's a good penis.

1298
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,973
That's... Stop freaking me out.

1299
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,519
You're the one talking
about your brother's dick,

1300
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,093
and how hard it is.

1301
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,829
I'm kidding, seriously.

1302
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:54,130
Weird joke, that wasn't very funny.

1303
01:00:54,131 --> 01:00:56,901
(bong burbling)

1304
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:59,204
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1305
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:01,788
(upbeat music)

1306
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:06,319
Stop it.

1307
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,320
Tony.

1308
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:10,123
Tony.

1309
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,401
(upbeat music)

1310
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,349
(crowd chattering)

1311
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:15,350
Tony.

1312
01:01:18,118 --> 01:01:22,999
♪ I'm a weirdo ♪

1313
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
♪ What the hell am I doing here ♪

1314
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:32,409
Ched, Ched, have you seen Tony?

1315
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:33,330
He's ours.

1316
01:01:33,331 --> 01:01:35,793
I could be everybody's.

1317
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:40,049
(crowd chattering)

1318
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:45,384
(door slamming shut)

1319
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:46,393
(screams)

1320
01:01:46,394 --> 01:01:48,561
(panting)

1321
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:52,879
(door slamming shut)

1322
01:01:59,225 --> 01:02:01,225
(moans)

1323
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:07,119
(slurping)

1324
01:02:09,543 --> 01:02:10,605
Sorry.

1325
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:13,189
(upbeat music)

1326
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,271
How are you even doing this?

1327
01:02:17,272 --> 01:02:18,896
I love hot dogs.

1328
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:21,059
I'm gonna eat yours right up,

1329
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:24,829
and swallow it so hard, it goes
down to the pit of my tummy.

1330
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:25,782
No.

1331
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,089
(water burbling)

1332
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,090
Sydney.

1333
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,979
Sydney.

1334
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,239
Have you seen Sydney?

1335
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,073
No.

1336
01:02:34,073 --> 01:02:35,010
Fuck you.

1337
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:37,553
Hey, your fly is down
you fucking asshole.

1338
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:38,887
(door slums shut)

1339
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:41,339
(upbeat music)

1340
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,507
Celebrate only, come on.

1341
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:49,786
Shots, shots, shots.

1342
01:02:49,787 --> 01:02:52,370
(upbeat music)

1343
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,780
Tom.

1344
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,830
Lisa.

1345
01:03:08,192 --> 01:03:09,392
Have you ever had sex?

1346
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,829
(upbeat music)

1347
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,663
[Charlie] Ouch.

1348
01:03:14,664 --> 01:03:16,279
(water splashing)

1349
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,439
You like movies?

1350
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,440
Yeah.

1351
01:03:21,815 --> 01:03:22,854
Come back.

1352
01:03:22,855 --> 01:03:24,272
Ah we gotta go.

1353
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,059
Lisa, can we go, now?

1354
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,759
Nice to meet you.

1355
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,557
Can I come with you?

1356
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,039
[Tony] All right, come on.

1357
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,040
I'm Violet.

1358
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:38,989
I'm Cage.

1359
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:41,288
Sometimes I feel like
I'm trapped in a cage.

1360
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:42,796
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1361
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:45,493
(panting)

1362
01:03:45,494 --> 01:03:47,861
(paper rustling)

1363
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:48,800
(shoes stomping)

1364
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,633
(panting)

1365
01:03:49,634 --> 01:03:51,839
(body thudding)

1366
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,016
Tony, I think I'm high.

1367
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:56,071
And I told those guys
that your dick is nice,

1368
01:03:56,072 --> 01:03:57,010
and it gets hard.

1369
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:57,930
What?

1370
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:58,763
Why did that come up?

1371
01:03:58,764 --> 01:04:00,709
I don't know, I got caught off guard.

1372
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,879
You told them about my dick?

1373
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,999
Yeah.

1374
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,959
Jeez, Lisa we've gotta
keep things between us, okay?

1375
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:06,979
Rule number one, rule.

1376
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,819
I thought rule number
one, was to be honest.

1377
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:09,653
No, yeah, that too.

1378
01:04:09,654 --> 01:04:12,129
And to be honest, I
didn't know we had rules.

1379
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,149
Look, whatever, I have a nice penis.

1380
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,459
So what if you told them?

1381
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,729
But honestly I gotta get going Lisa,

1382
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,819
because right now, there's honestly...

1383
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,539
Up, there she is, okay.
- Tony wait.

1384
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,439
You're hot, you're great, you have stuff

1385
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,729
going on down there, that's crazy.

1386
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:25,809
What do you mean?

1387
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:26,700
I touched it.

1388
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,533
Tony?

1389
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,863
She did not touch it, okay?

1390
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:31,819
Okay, so she touched it,
but I did not want that.

1391
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,740
I did not want any of that.

1392
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:34,629
Are you jealous because I'm pretty?

1393
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,639
Hey, whatever the fuck your name is,

1394
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,579
that's my sister you're talking to.

1395
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,469
You're a nightmare, and Brian deserves

1396
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:43,089
better than some cum-guzzling bitch.

1397
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:44,060
Whoa.

1398
01:04:44,061 --> 01:04:45,457
Whoa.

1399
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:46,458
Whoa,

1400
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:48,930
Let's go.

1401
01:04:51,132 --> 01:04:53,382
(groaning)

1402
01:04:54,873 --> 01:04:57,623
(shoes stomping)

1403
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:03,929
Oh shit, look who it
is, it's the change guy.

1404
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,821
Guys, how's it going?

1405
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:07,109
You guys look great.

1406
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,669
It's like seeing a, you know,
a teacher in the real world.

1407
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,897
Except you want to fuck her.

1408
01:05:10,898 --> 01:05:11,762
(laughs)

1409
01:05:11,763 --> 01:05:13,097
Don't you always want to fuck her.

1410
01:05:13,098 --> 01:05:14,070
(body thudding)

1411
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:16,389
Anyway, how's things going?

1412
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:17,223
What are you doing tonight?

1413
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:18,056
We're good.

1414
01:05:18,056 --> 01:05:18,937
We were gonna go.

1415
01:05:18,938 --> 01:05:20,669
Oh, we love the parties.

1416
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:21,739
Wait, what?

1417
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,943
Stick around.

1418
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,258
Fight.

1419
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:27,553
Fucking stop, man, yo what's up, man.

1420
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:28,557
Why am I gonna fucking chill?

1421
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:29,476
Shut up, man.

1422
01:05:29,477 --> 01:05:30,839
I'm not gonna fucking
chill, bitch is size.

1423
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,909
It doesn't matter, man.

1424
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,133
It does matter, bitch.

1425
01:05:33,134 --> 01:05:34,459
Tony, I wanna go home.

1426
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,440
Okay, lets go.

1427
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:37,859
Hey, Hey Lisa, can I
talk to you for a second?

1428
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,409
We're leaving.

1429
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,839
Not talking to you, you fucking idiot.

1430
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,820
Man, we'll get out of your hair.

1431
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:44,329
Dude, get off me, all right?

1432
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:45,843
I need to talk to Lisa, hey.

1433
01:05:45,844 --> 01:05:47,119
(hand grabbing)

1434
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,509
Don't touch her.

1435
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,679
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

1436
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,330
Hey, I'm not done talking...

1437
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:54,997
(hand grabbing)

1438
01:05:54,998 --> 01:05:57,915
(crowd chattering)

1439
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,525
Why do you like my dick so much, huh?

1440
01:06:01,526 --> 01:06:02,394
You like that?

1441
01:06:02,394 --> 01:06:03,227
You like that?

1442
01:06:03,228 --> 01:06:05,009
No man, you like that.

1443
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:06,179
The fuck did you say to me?

1444
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,330
You know what I said.

1445
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,677
(tense music)

1446
01:06:10,678 --> 01:06:14,227
(crowd cheering)

1447
01:06:14,228 --> 01:06:15,978
You'll think of me.

1448
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,993
They always think of me.

1449
01:06:19,994 --> 01:06:21,687
(tense music)

1450
01:06:21,688 --> 01:06:23,829
(door sliding open)

1451
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:24,830
Brian, come on.

1452
01:06:25,513 --> 01:06:26,513
Ched, Ched.

1453
01:06:27,876 --> 01:06:28,709
Ched, come on.

1454
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,185
Dude, no, no, no, dude
I'm trying to chill.

1455
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:32,019
There we go.

1456
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,900
Tony, Tony, come on, let's go.

1457
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:36,339
(crowd chattering)

1458
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,809
Are you a guy who likes me

1459
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:40,241
to call his dick, a conqueror penis?

1460
01:06:40,242 --> 01:06:41,231
I like dick.

1461
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,090
Me too.

1462
01:06:42,091 --> 01:06:43,800
(laughs)

1463
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:45,902
(tense music)

1464
01:06:45,903 --> 01:06:46,863
Where is she at?

1465
01:06:46,864 --> 01:06:48,452
Where's the other one?

1466
01:06:48,453 --> 01:06:49,635
Yeah.

1467
01:06:49,636 --> 01:06:52,136
(tense music)

1468
01:06:53,272 --> 01:06:55,199
Just leave me here.

1469
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,617
Hurry, hurry, right, right.

1470
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,455
(panting)

[Rachel] Or we could both (mumbles)

it's not even time yet.

1553

You see, this is why we never worked out.

1554
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,109
Because you don't know how
to fucking communicate.

You're coming way too early.
