1
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>In the '90s,</i>

2
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,190
<i>when soda was good and marijuana was bad,</i>

3
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,651
<i>mortals sealed their love story</i>

4
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,530
<i>with a list of songs
they recorded on a cassette.</i>

5
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,114
THE SOUNDTRACK TO OUR STORY

6
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:34,410
<i>Each song represented
a unique moment in their story.</i>

7
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:39,497
<i>But the years went by,
marijuana was legalized in some places,</i>

8
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,332
<i>and soda was shunned,</i>

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,586
<i>and that cassette... was forgotten.</i>

10
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,555
Five hundred years.

11
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,768
My first vacation in 500 years,
and this is what they do to me?

12
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,904
Damn. Watch out.

13
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,283
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,620
- Sorry, I didn't realize you were...
- What?

15
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:01,664
Blind?

16
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,206
No, I can see perfectly.

17
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,291
You're the one with problems
with his vision.

18
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,585
I don't have time for this.

19
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,508
- What? Is there a problem?
- Lots of problems.

20
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,512
Instead of being on a safari,
I'm here because of you.

21
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,016
But anyway, let's do this quickly.

22
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,187
This is yours.

23
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,850
{\an8}HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY

24
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,849
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

25
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:40,823
Hello.

26
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,164
No music in this house
means no music in this house,

27
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,667
I thought we were clear on that.

28
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,178
Red Post-it means it's yours.
Green Post-it means it's mine.

29
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,478
Wow. How very fair.

30
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,730
You said you didn't want anything.

31
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:16,357
"I don't want anything
that reminds me of us"

32
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,152
doesn't mean
"I don't want any of our possessions."

33
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,863
For a lawyer,
you don't make things very clear.

34
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,534
For a musician,
you've got bad hearing, no?

35
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,913
Cheers.

36
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,879
Wow. Did I hear that right?

37
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,632
- You finally accepted that I make music?
- Yes.

38
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,392
Look. Clause three.
The house is yours, like we agreed.

39
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,148
So that you can make your music.

40
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,499
What was it called? Your little band?

41
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,919
- The Skates.
- The Skates.

42
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,838
You weren't bad.
At least for weddings, and parties.

43
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,508
No, in fact, we were pretty good.

44
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,095
Could you let me finish reading this?
Thanks.

45
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,812
- Can I say something?
- Sure.

46
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,397
There's nothing more annoying
than your obsession

47
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,608
with chewing ice all the time.

48
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,819
- It annoys you?
- I've had it up to here.

49
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,612
This whole time you said it was cool.

50
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,532
Well I lied. Happy? I can't stand it.

51
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,951
There are all kinds of things
I'm sick of too!

52
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,370
Like what?

53
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,680
- The ham slicer is mine.
- You gave that to me.

54
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:14,600
Seriously? Out of everything in the house?
Just this?

55
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,646
What do you expect me to do
with a fucking lemon squeezer?

56
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,649
Make lemonade.

57
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,499
MANÁ
WHERE WILL THE CHILDREN PLAY?

58
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,468
That's yours.

59
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,056
You wanted it, right?

60
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,977
Remember?

61
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,314
You paid for it.

62
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,197
Carlos, this is ridiculous.

63
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,073
Can't we talk about it?

64
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,702
I think we've done too much talking,
and it's clear.

65
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,750
We made a mistake.

66
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,419
You think?

67
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,801
Because... I did fall in love.

68
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,057
- You were so...
- Handsome?

69
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,439
Interesting.

70
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,320
You were a whole new world for me.

71
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,785
It seems only like yesterday
that we went to that concert and...

72
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,830
I don't remember anything
about the concert.

73
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,042
I just remember you.

74
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,586
Looking at me.

75
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,592
You were... You are different.

76
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,518
Wow. That's by far
the nicest compliment I've ever gotten.

77
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,521
I was looking for something different.

78
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,356
What do you mean?

79
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,318
- Different from what? From whom?
- It doesn't matter.

80
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,155
But that day, at the concert...

81
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,287
Well, Cupid got it wrong, right?

82
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,215
Fucking Cupid.

83
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,008
Seriously?

84
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,347
This is how you want to do things?

85
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,655
THE SOUNDTRACK TO OUR STORY

86
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,134
- Was it you?
- How could it have been me?

87
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,804
- Then someone's in the house.
- There's no one here.

88
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,099
I just turned off the stereo.

89
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,809
Of course you did.

90
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,272
I promise you I just turned it off.
There's someone here...

91
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,042
- Carlos, someone's in the house.
- You think?

92
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,092
Do you see anyone?

93
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,930
Are you expecting someone?

94
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,144
Take anything you want. Anything!

95
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:08,520
You?

96
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,148
- But in formal attire, dude.
- You know him?

97
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,693
I just saw him on the street,
but I'm calling the police.

98
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,238
- Where's my phone?
- Here it is, darling.

99
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,865
How is that possible?

100
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:25,996
How do I know? I was born this way.
I've done it for thousands of years.

101
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,664
Who is he?

102
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,922
So worked up just because
I dropped in unannounced.

103
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,009
This is how you treat guests?

104
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,976
You think I'm a burglar, right?

105
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,105
What would I even steal?

106
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,485
Take whatever you want with a red Post-it.

107
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,323
It's clear you're not familiar
with Cupid's Code of Honor.

108
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,076
- Whose?
- Cupid's.

109
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,705
Cupid!

110
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,332
- Did he say Cupid?
- Yes, he did.

111
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,044
- Say my name once more and I'm gone.
- Cupid.

112
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,339
- I'm still here.
- Cupid doesn't exist.

113
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,718
Well, we do. There are a few of us.
I'm the one you got.

114
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:28,350
But we come in all shapes and sizes.
Black, blond, tall, he, she, they.

115
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,686
The baby in a diaper
with a bow and arrow, that too.

116
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,940
But no, Charlie, we don't exist.
Here I am, look.

117
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,194
Appearing and disappearing in your house,
drinking your cheap whisky.

118
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,030
- Who are you and what do you want?
- I don't want anything.

119
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,409
Cupids give. We give love.

120
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,246
That's what we do.
We're not harming anyone.

121
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,248
But could you?

122
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,334
Of course, but that's not the point.

123
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,004
My first day of vacation
and I'm stuck here with you.

124
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,130
Why?

125
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:05,928
Because you thought, you decided,
for some fucking reason, I made a mistake.

126
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,098
And I, Cupid, am never wrong.

127
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,892
I don't get it.

128
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:17,524
Let's suppose that out of pure chance,

129
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,695
life's circumstances, twists of fate,

130
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:27,075
past mistakes, pain that destroys love,

131
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:34,707
it was actually the both of you
who messed up, or rather, fucked up.

132
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,543
Couldn't you be the one who fucked up
from the beginning?

133
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,295
So you really think he's Cupid?

134
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,714
I don't know, but if he is,
I want a refund.

135
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,465
What? Is something funny?

136
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,510
Let's see if it's funny
when I call the cops.

137
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,597
No, Charlie. This isn't a joke.

138
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,225
- It's an offer.
- And what are you offering?

139
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,561
- Seriously?
- I don't know, we've got to ask.

140
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,648
I'm offering you to never
fall in love with each other.

141
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,609
What do you say?

142
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,405
Happy Valentine's Day.

143
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,783
What happened?

144
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,747
- I don't know.
- Carlos, this cube was...

145
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,046
So, what do you think?
Get in, darlings, let's go for a spin.

146
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:25,466
Not a chance,
first explain how the fuck...

147
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,801
Did we get in the car?

148
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,054
- Carlos, what's happening?
- I don't know.

149
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,015
Let's get something clear.
I don't owe anyone explanations.

150
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,350
Least of all mortals.

151
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,978
And the car? Have some respect, dude.
It's a classic.

152
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,563
My mom gave it to me.

153
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,776
I'm Cupid. What did you think?
I'd take you on the subway?

154
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,488
Get ready for the ride of your lives,
little ones.

155
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,328
- Not so fast, please.
- Elenita, it's not that fast. Relax.

156
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,996
Eyes on the road, please.

157
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:01,419
My eyes are always on the road.
The question is, what about yours?

158
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,755
Carlos, what's happening?
Where are we going?

159
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,881
To the past.

160
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,800
- Where's the seatbelt?
- There isn't one.

161
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,967
What?

162
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,970
- A car!
- Where?

163
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,599
- Concentrate on what's important!
- I'm doing just that.

164
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,976
I don't make mistakes.
I don't get it wrong. Understood?

165
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,939
Me neither. And then there's this.

166
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,067
I twist this side
and it fucks up the other.

167
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,486
I twist that side and fuck up this one.

168
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,115
- Concentrate on driving now!
- Hey, mortals.

169
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,742
I'm going to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

170
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,953
And I've got lots of them.

171
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,205
I'm going to give you
the extraordinary opportunity

172
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:43,210
to prove that I was wrong,
which isn't the case.

173
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,589
And if I'm wrong, I'll fix it,
which isn't going to happen.

174
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,592
So please, relax already.

175
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,262
Elen, get that look off your face,
for the love of God.

176
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:57,182
Charlie, relax, please. You're panting.
You're gonna have a panic attack.

177
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,935
Breathe in and out.

178
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:04,648
In and out. In and out.

179
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,026
Hold on tight
because we're headed for the past. Yeah!

180
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,863
2024
THE FUTURE IS HERE

181
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,788
We're here, darlings. Thank you.

182
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,709
Where?

183
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,835
- We're here?
- Yes.

184
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,839
- In heaven?
- You guys? Yeah, right.

185
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,761
- Where are we?
- Are we... dead?

186
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,723
No, honey, you've still got...
a few years.

187
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,935
- The car... The car is...
- Adapted to the time period, Elen.

188
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,440
We have to blend in, right? Lame.

189
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,614
That's Cristina's house.
It's the party where...

190
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,492
Okay, guys, pay attention,
both of you, okay?

191
00:17:56,493 --> 00:18:01,497
When the soundtrack to our story ends,
<i>kaputt, finito,</i> okay?

192
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,999
We'll go back to your sad reality,
or whatever.

193
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,336
So you only have five songs left.

194
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:08,712
Capisce?

195
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,006
No, I don't "capisce."

196
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,633
Fuck!

197
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,301
Again.

198
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,428
Bye!

199
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:20,934
Watch out!

200
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,979
Sorry. Sorry.

201
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,696
Sorry. I didn't see you there.

202
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,907
Well, I was looking where I was going,

203
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,328
but then you came out of nowhere
and I couldn't stop.

204
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,832
- Are you okay, sir?
- Elena.

205
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,418
How do you know my name? Ma'am!

206
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,503
- Elena.
- Is she okay?

207
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,089
- She just needs air.
- I'll get water if you like.

208
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,841
- No, it's fine.
- It was my fault.

209
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,758
No, it's fine.

210
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,386
- I scared her.
- No, she just needs air, that's all.

211
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,346
Air. Okay.

212
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,766
How's it going? Is this where the gig is?

213
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,476
- She's fainted.
- Hang on.

214
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,603
Awesome.

215
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,818
We don't know what to do.

216
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,575
- What are you doing?
- Damn, I swear I dreamed that...

217
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,618
Gabo?

218
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,414
Gabo.

219
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,292
Whoa, hi, do we know each other?

220
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,672
Sorry, we've had a really long trip.

221
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:38,093
And with the time change and the jet lag,
it's been a long time.

222
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,680
Time traveling is complicated, but...

223
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,767
Paco, Beto, Memo. I can't believe it.

224
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,228
Wow, bro, she's psycho!

225
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,564
Eleniux, your mom is a psychic.

226
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,483
- No, my mom's dead.
- Oh, yeah.

227
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,570
You're The Skates, right?

228
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,698
- Yeah!
- Wow, we're famous.

229
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,033
We know you from Instagram...

230
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,242
- From where?
- Insta-what?

231
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,578
- What's that?
- Is that a bar?

232
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:10,919
- Aren't you going to be late?
- No, but how do you know us?

233
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,006
We're music managers.

234
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,843
We manage lots of small bands
that we're...

235
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,094
We're a band!

236
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,930
We're always looking for new talent.

237
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:27,351
- We look for new bands, help them grow...
- So they really take off.

238
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,646
- That's crazy.
- And we saw you in Gatopardo yesterday.

239
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,732
- Yes.
- And we liked what we heard.

240
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,858
You were at the gig?

241
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,485
- Exactly.
- Yes.

242
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:40,949
And you really reminded me of myself
when I was young.

243
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,368
Well, we're going to play again
in a bit, at the party.

244
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,662
Yes, we want to watch if we can.

245
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,498
Sure, in fact, we have to go.
It's our turn.

246
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,917
- Let's go.
- Okay.

247
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,087
Okay, see you in a bit.

248
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,714
Pleasure to meet you.

249
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,218
Hey, later you'll have to tell me
where Instagram is. Sounds cool.

250
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:05,348
- Yeah.
- Sounds up-and-coming.

251
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,017
Up-and-coming...

252
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,610
Right, if today's the party,
tomorrow is the Maná concert.

253
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,196
In 24 hours.

254
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,658
- Tomorrow is when we...
- Have our first kiss.

255
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,286
And the rest is history.
What if we never went to the concert?

256
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,706
We don't have our first kiss.

257
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,500
And we don't fall in love.

258
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,337
And we change the plot of our story.

259
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,718
We came to pick up our son. Excuse us.

260
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,664
Careful, there's a cable here.

261
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,002
Where's Charlie? Over there?

262
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,422
- I'll see you a little later.
- Chickless.

263
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,012
Maybe people shouldn't walk
across as much.

264
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,142
Dude! Found you.

265
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:18,606
- Excuse me. How are you?
- You're a legend, Chickless.

266
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,863
No, no. Get your own. They're over there.

267
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,573
I need these two, dude.

268
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,243
They're called Goodbye, Shame
and Hello, Courage.

269
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,287
Courage for what?

270
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,167
For the hunt, man.
I'm getting me a girl, dude.

271
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,461
I'll believe it when I see it.

272
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,214
You couldn't hook up with a coat hanger.
You're "chick-less".

273
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,592
Bro, I won't say anything to that
because you're...

274
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,387
Well, you were my wingman.

275
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,013
Don't be an ass, Chickless.

276
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,307
I'm not an ass.

277
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,560
- Photo, boys? For the magazine.
- Yes, please.

278
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,478
Please.

279
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,732
- There. One more.
- Of course.

280
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,943
Another pose.

281
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,653
Look serious.

282
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,323
- Thanks.
- Cool.

283
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,995
Look, man. There's our prey.

284
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,039
Go ahead.

285
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,043
I miss you, Charlie. I miss you, man.

286
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,297
We were like Maverick and Goose
in <i>Top Gun.</i>

287
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,592
But you died on me.

288
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,053
We don't go to war together anymore.

289
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,641
- Wait, hang on.
- Yeah?

290
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,518
Am I Goose?

291
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,149
Of course. Only I could be Maverick.
I'm just like Tom Cruise.

292
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,152
Right. Tell me, who drives your Ninja?

293
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,655
- Just you.
- That's what I thought.

294
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,490
Charlie!

295
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,165
- Cristi...
- I want one too. Thanks for the drink!

296
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,959
- Should we take a picture?
- Yeah.

297
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,464
Thank you so much.

298
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,967
- She took away your shame, man.
- I've still got plenty of courage.

299
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,345
Cheers, my love.

300
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,847
Cheers.

301
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,810
I'll go get Disappointment and Loneliness.

302
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,356
- New friends?
- New drinks.

303
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,817
Well, are you ready?

304
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,028
- Seriously?
- Of course, sweetie.

305
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,572
I'll give them to the girls,
and you to the boys, okay?

306
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:37,036
- Really?
- Yes. Happy Valentine's Day, sweethearts!

307
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,914
Come on.

308
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:45,253
Thanks for coming. Enjoy. You're so cute.

309
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,713
Come with me.

310
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,012
- Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie.
- Here you go.

311
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,682
Charlie, keep some candles for the cake
for tomorrow's dinner.

312
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,684
What dinner? Happy Valentine's...

313
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,728
My whole family is coming to celebrate
my grandma turning almost 90.

314
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,648
My uncle, a top lawyer,
is also going to be there.

315
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,485
He negotiated NAFTA and all.
And guess what?

316
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,737
I told him about you.

317
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,909
Cutie, you're in shock.

318
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,581
You know, it's better to know who
than to know how.

319
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,334
But Cristi, tomorrow is the Maná concert,

320
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,337
I already have the tickets, remember?

321
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,925
Charlie, how many birthdays do you think
my grandma is going to have?

322
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:40,473
Cristi, but... they're VIP, I bought them
ages ago and they cost a fortune.

323
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,560
You bought them last week in...

324
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:47,606
A photo for the magazine. Nice and close.

325
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,735
- Is that a camera?
- Yes.

326
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,114
- What magazine are you from?
<i>- Eres?</i>

327
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,162
What are you doing?

328
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,205
Happy Valentine's Day.

329
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:10,211
Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!
Sofi, you look lovely. Enjoy.

330
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,630
My love, when did you ask me?

331
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,758
Because I have no memory of
wanting to see...

332
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,468
Maná, Cristi. Maná.

333
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:20,305
But, why would I go and see them?
I don't like their music,

334
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,016
I don't like the vibe.
I don't feel like going.

335
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:26,728
Enjoy! I mean, if it were
Luis Miguel, I'd think about it.

336
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,941
- But Maná? Really?
- Cristi, it's live and VIP.

337
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:36,697
This dinner could make your life
VIP forever.

338
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,742
Get it?

339
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,373
My love, I can't go. My parents
will kill me if I'm not at the dinner.

340
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:53,381
But I promise you'll have
an incredible time with me.

341
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,260
I went to the concert, but not with her.

342
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,222
Anyway, it's showtime.

343
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:12,149
If anyone here still believes in love,
Happy Valentine's Day.

344
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:18,780
A candle.

345
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,158
- To sing to love.
- Right.

346
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,703
- Charlie!
- What's up?

347
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,164
I'll see you in my dreams, sweetie.

348
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,128
What an amazing woman!

349
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,384
She's just very pretty, that young lady.
You're very lucky to have her.

350
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,805
- She's your future. Trust me.
- Okay.

351
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:47,435
- And buy dollars.
- Dollars?

352
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,190
Thanks so much for coming.

353
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,152
It's time to sing our tribute to love.

354
00:28:57,153 --> 00:29:00,281
So, light your candles

355
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,784
and grab your other half.

356
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,244
Charlie!

357
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,330
It's nice to be talked to like that.

358
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,042
- Come up here, sweetie.
- Go on.

359
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,880
- Sweetie, come up here!
- Go for it.

360
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,552
- Come on.
- No photos. Seriously.

361
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,139
- Seriously.
- Yes.

362
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:37,151
This is Charlie, the sweetness in my life.

363
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,237
Everyone!

364
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,324
<i>I'm here</i>

365
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:47,369
<i>So in love</i>

366
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,162
<i>With you</i>

367
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:54,459
<i>The night lasts a little longer</i>

368
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,673
<i>The cry of a city</i>

369
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:05,845
<i>The humidity can be seen on our faces</i>

370
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:10,767
<i>I'll be by your side
For longer than life</i>

371
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:16,398
<i>I swear I'll love you more up above</i>

372
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:33,249
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Thank you.

373
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,003
Charlie.

374
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,131
I love you, sweetie.

375
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,009
Will you light my candle?

376
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:45,511
Okay.

377
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,514
Hurry.

378
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:56,021
Happy Valentine's Day, sweeties!

379
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,530
We're the best.

380
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,452
The candle. Hey!

381
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,081
I love you.

382
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,585
The candle. Hey!

383
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,672
What's happening?

384
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:23,798
Fire.

385
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,882
- Fire?
- Fire.

386
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,843
- Where? What's happening?
- Excuse me.

387
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,512
- Fire!
- I'm gonna die! Put it out!

388
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,724
Put it out! Put it...

389
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:40,816
Cristi, wait!

390
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,824
- Chickless! Chickless!
- It was all down to Disappointment.

391
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,287
Maybe it's best
to blow out your candles, please.

392
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,706
Chickless is so brave!

393
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:02,629
Right, well,
after that beautiful performance

394
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,467
by the princess and her sweetie,

395
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,344
we're going to play a few tunes.

396
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,929
We're The Skates!

397
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,769
And tonight we have a very special guest.

398
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,063
Katy Berry.

399
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,279
Can you hear me? Yes.

400
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,492
Hi. Good evening, everyone. Hello.

401
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:36,162
I'm really happy to be here today.

402
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,749
Thanks for the invite.
It's going to be great.

403
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,087
One, two, three, four!

404
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:14,952
<i>It's a bad idea to raise my blood pressure</i>

405
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,663
<i>To squash my ambition</i>

406
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:22,251
<i>Carry on and you'll see</i>

407
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:28,632
<i>I look at my watch
It's much later than yesterday</i>

408
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,802
<i>I would wait for you again</i>

409
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:36,056
<i>And I won't do it
I won't do it</i>

410
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:42,270
<i>Where is our mistake with no solution?</i>

411
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:46,566
<i>Was it my fault or yours?</i>

412
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:50,737
<i>You can't change me, no one can</i>

413
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:54,198
<i>A thousand bells play in my heart</i>

414
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:58,954
<i>It's so difficult to say sorry</i>

415
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,056
Stop.

416
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:31,737
<i>Go, you never understood me</i>

417
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,366
Sorry.

418
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,914
- Are you crazy or what?
- I'm fine. I'm fine...

419
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,458
You've got a screw lose.

420
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,503
- Hey, but who's going to pay us?
- The console's fucked.

421
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:54,592
Hey, hey. Calm down.
It was an accident and everything's fine.

422
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,094
Calm down?
Your psycho partner ruined the show.

423
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,931
Chill, don't be like that.

424
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:02,726
Damn it.

425
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,020
Are you okay?

426
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,481
Did you get burned?

427
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,401
Yes, but I'm fine.

428
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,029
Can I see?

429
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,704
- Yes, it looks worse than it is.
- Yes, it does feel...

430
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,253
Sorry.

431
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,588
- No, it's fine.
- Hold it there.

432
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,591
Okay.

433
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,263
Give me your hand. There.

434
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:47,729
There.

435
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,689
- There you go.
- Thanks.

436
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,983
- Better?
- Yes, thanks.

437
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,068
- Carlos!
- What?

438
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,946
- Fucking do something!
- What?

439
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,282
I'm going to fall in love.

440
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,368
You dropped these.

441
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,162
No...

442
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,793
You're going to see Maná!

443
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,256
- In theory.
- What do you mean "in theory"?

444
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:19,218
You're joking, right? I was dying to go,

445
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,221
but I couldn't get tickets.

446
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,225
You're... a big fan.

447
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,478
Totally, I love them.
The thing is, I'm from Guadalajara,

448
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:33,190
Maná is practically my ZIP code.

449
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,153
- Right.
- What are you doing?

450
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:41,992
Nothing.

451
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,245
Sorry.

452
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:51,043
I've got this obsession
with chewing ice when...

453
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,962
It's really annoying, right?

454
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,634
No, it's cool.

455
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,887
- Really?
- Yeah.

456
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:05,848
See? You always said it was really cool.

457
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,936
With you looking and smiling
at me like that, what was I going to say?

458
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,481
I was handsome, right?

459
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,733
You were.

460
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,780
I don't understand how you can have
the tickets in your hand and not go.

461
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,659
I'm being a bit intense, right?

462
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:28,372
- What's your name?
- Too intense, definitely.

463
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,754
I hate that fucking smile of yours.

464
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,093
Not yours, his.

465
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:44,846
What's your name?

466
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,184
Elena. Yours?

467
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,188
- I...
- Sweetie, right?

468
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:59,277
I'm Carlos. Nice to meet you.

469
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,364
Nice to meet you, Carlos.

470
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,968
No, where is everyone?

471
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,765
Charlie!

472
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,185
- Charlie!
- She's looking for you.

473
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,646
I have to go.

474
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,314
- Good luck.
- But...

475
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,191
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.

476
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,653
- Wait, tomorrow? Why?
- Charlie!

477
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,535
Charlie!

478
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,124
Cristi, are you okay?

479
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,002
I wanted to say sorry for...

480
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,337
Where is everyone?
What happened to the music?

481
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,842
- Aren't you angry with me?
- Aren't you listening? Do something!

482
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,479
I can't believe it!

483
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:23,779
- He gave me his ticket! To see Maná. VIP!
- Wow.

484
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,240
And he's so handsome, right?

485
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,784
- Yes.
- Yeah?

486
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,578
I don't know, not really.

487
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,372
I mean, he looks like
he's got bad intentions.

488
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,460
What? No, not at all.

489
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,012
What's up?

490
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,723
You won't believe what just happened.

491
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,558
What?

492
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,477
Me? Bad intentions?

493
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,106
- We've got to...
- No, I'm a gentleman and you know it.

494
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,608
We have to do whatever's necessary
to change our future.

495
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,112
Of course, you and I are like...
like the Terminator.

496
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:09,365
We've come from the future
to change our present

497
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,825
and save our fates.

498
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,453
- That's so cheesy.
- But it's true.

499
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:18,041
The console's fucked.
Everyone left, we can't play.

500
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,921
We don't need that to play.

501
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,756
What do we do?

502
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,676
I don't know, we have to make sure
they don't go to the concert.

503
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:31,220
Thanks, Einstein, that much was obvious.

504
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,389
I don't know. We take her ticket.

505
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,935
- Steal it?
- No, that's a crime. We just take it.

506
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,335
<i>He met her at 15</i>

507
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,546
That's my song!

508
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:10,385
<i>He opened the blue door
Fell in love</i>

509
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,513
<i>Dreams in the air</i>

510
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,809
<i>Diamonds fall from the sky</i>

511
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,189
<i>Not enough to live on</i>

512
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:29,112
<i>Again and again
He stayed in her arms</i>

513
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:36,994
<i>Kneeling at her feet
He fell</i>

514
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:41,165
<i>Seduces like a heart
Leads to fragility</i>

515
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,793
This story's worse than the original.

516
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,630
I think it's better.

517
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,758
That's why it's worse.
The beginning of the end.

518
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,928
<i>A blue door</i>

519
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:57,224
<i>Should never be opened</i>

520
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,726
<i>The nightmares are very long...</i>

521
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:04,021
Tomorrow he takes her to the concert,
they fall in love and...

522
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,149
A few years later we're sticking on
red and green Post-its.

523
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,238
<i>A blue door shouldn't even be touched</i>

524
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,825
<i>It's better to leave it</i>

525
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,954
I know that look.

526
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,586
Great song!

527
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,674
Amazing!

528
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,595
The locks never worked.

529
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,437
Hey!

530
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,985
You had a gun in the van?

531
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,446
We worked at night. We had to be careful.

532
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,200
Hey, hey!

533
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,327
- I'll take it.
- In your dreams.

534
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,745
You don't know how to use it.

535
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:06,418
The question is, where are we going
to corner your mini-me?

536
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,753
Why my mini-me and not your mini-me?

537
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,884
Because I'm not missing that concert,
and I've got the gun.

538
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,472
If the past hasn't changed yet,

539
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,600
I know where to find me tomorrow.

540
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,437
Perfect.

541
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,314
Fuck!

542
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,027
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

543
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,946
The safety wasn't on.

544
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,413
There are two left.

545
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,541
- Two what?
- Two songs.

546
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,820
{\an8}If this goes well and we get
a second chance,

547
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,531
I hope you don't waste it.

548
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,367
I can't believe
you're still on about that.

549
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,244
I don't know if you've really got
the talent to be a musician.

550
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,664
I do know you think
that's your true passion, and it's not.

551
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,209
Your passion is being a mom,
and that's the truth.

552
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,669
That's enough.

553
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,756
Being a mom and living my dream
are not mutually exclusive,

554
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,132
they never were.

555
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,345
But it was impossible for you
to understand that, and I gave in.

556
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:45,349
- Don't get so worked up about it.
- I will if I want to.

557
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,518
But you know what? I'm not angry with you.

558
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,146
I'm furious with myself
for having stayed silent.

559
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:54,943
Because if what happened hadn't happened,
I'm sure I still would be silent.

560
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,612
You were holding back, then.

561
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,411
- Let's get this over with, okay?
- Yes.

562
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,582
- You don't even know where we are.
- Of course I do.

563
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,876
It's that way.

564
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,508
That way, that way.

565
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:24,514
After what happened with Cristi's hair,
I highly doubt...

566
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,600
she'll throw another party.

567
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,812
The thing is... Thanks. I turned around...

568
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,606
- and she was standing there.
- Who?

569
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,234
- Elena.
- Elena.

570
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,903
Singing amazingly.

571
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,113
She skates great.

572
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,783
And when I saw her eyes, I froze.
It was like...

573
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,545
- I'll swap you Higuita for Stoichkov.
- Sure.

574
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:01,175
Roberto Baggio. Italian.

575
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:03,635
He's a machine. Never missed a penalty.

576
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,929
Are you listening, man?

577
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,681
Of course not.

578
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:12,186
But anyway, you saw her, boom,
she captivated you, boom,

579
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:15,647
and here we are.
I'm hungover, you're sober,

580
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,234
you've got a girl, I've got a drink,
same as ever.

581
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,196
ICE CREAM AND COFFEE

582
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,366
Got Batistuta?

583
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,828
- I don't know...
- Have a good look.

584
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,295
Let's go.

585
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,674
- Here he is. What have you got for me?
- Hang on.

586
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,305
Table for two?

587
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,267
- We're with friends, thanks.
- Great, come in.

588
00:46:56,064 --> 00:47:00,193
- Dude... Ramoncito Ramírez.
- Give it here.

589
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:02,819
Katy Berry?

590
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,531
You? Have you brought the photos?

591
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:08,992
Easy, or my partner will
put a bullet in you.

592
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,286
Move over.

593
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,666
Relax, we're not bad people.

594
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:19,003
- We're good at doing bad things.
- Really good.

595
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,340
What do you want?

596
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,553
The concert ticket.

597
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:28,845
What are you talking about?

598
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,766
The ticket that's in your wallet
next to the photo of Brooke Shields.

599
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:35,227
- Oh, man, I'll give you all my money.
- You don't have any.

600
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,895
- Take my watch.
- It's fake.

601
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,397
- I knew it.
- I'll give you my car.

602
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:41,108
Your car? Your GTS Turbo?

603
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,652
Just so you can go
to the concert with her?

604
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,572
- Seriously?
- Really?

605
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,241
Your mom is called Valeria
and your dad, like you, is Carlos too.

606
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,868
You're an only child,
you have hay fever, according to you.

607
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,037
You've actually got
a bit of a gluten problem.

608
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,999
- What's gluten?
- You wear underwear with cartoons on.

609
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,587
You support Dallas.
You bet on the Super Bowl.

610
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:04,256
Your girlfriend is Cristi,
you've been together for a year,

611
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:06,175
and you'd be stupid to let her get away.

612
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,847
- Your cologne is expensive, right?
- You use a shitload.

613
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:15,684
Your turbocharged Shadow GTS,
with detachable stereo

614
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:19,314
and JBL speakers that rock your world...

615
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,192
That's the stuff you love most
in life, right?

616
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,029
Sorry, excuse me.

617
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,114
CALL ME - MOM

618
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:32,035
My mom. Continue, please.

619
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:35,955
Hey.

620
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,957
I know everything about you, don't I?

621
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:44,296
Dude, this is next level intelligence.

622
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,548
I've read about cases like this.

623
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,508
The next step is torture with water.

624
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,470
We don't have all day,
so put the ticket on the table now.

625
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:55,016
Okay, okay. Chill, chill.

626
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,688
Run, Charlie.

627
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,820
No! Don't torture me, please!

628
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,160
Calm down, calm down.

629
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,208
- Give me the ticket and I'll go.
- Why me? Why this ticket?

630
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:22,835
I'm you from the future.

631
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,130
Can't you see that? Well, I'm a bit older.

632
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:31,344
I'm like the Terminator, I've come from
the future to change the past, present...

633
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,138
and change your destiny a little,
that's all.

634
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,724
- I haven't seen <i>Terminator.</i>
- Right.

635
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,686
We're here to stop you
from marrying Elena.

636
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,398
- Marry her? I just met her.
- Please.

637
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,151
You changed your clothes six times.

638
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:49,612
The leather jacket, then the denim one.

639
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,492
You spent three hours thinking
about where to take her to dinner.

640
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,037
Bad night, right?

641
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,624
You couldn't sleep
because you kept thinking about her.

642
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,127
Carlos.

643
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,713
Elena isn't good for you.

644
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,549
Will you stay with Cristina?

645
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,508
- Give it to me!
- No!

646
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,552
Carlos!

647
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,640
Freeze, everyone! Freeze!

648
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,308
No videos for social media!

649
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:25,106
I'll shoot the first person I see
uploading a video to TikTok!

650
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,484
Hey!

651
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,612
Put your phones away.

652
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:43,248
If you kill him, you kill me. Calm down.

653
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,293
Give me the ticket.

654
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,344
Have you ever looked into someone's eyes
and immediately saw their soul?

655
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,554
Give me the ticket, please.

656
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,432
That was how I felt yesterday.

657
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:04,145
Looking into her eyes was worth more
than 1,000 conversations.

658
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,481
I'm serious.

659
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,818
It's not just a concert.
It's seeing her again.

660
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,237
What for?

661
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,783
To start a thousand conversations.

662
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,078
- She's not good for you.
- Didn't you hear me?

663
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,874
She's the love of my life,
so now I have to convince her

664
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,460
that I'm the love of her life.

665
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,131
I want to win her over.

666
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,551
I'm going to do it
and I'm going to make her happy.

667
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,057
That's why I have to go to that concert.

668
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,102
Please, don't take this ticket away.

669
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:49,565
Please.

670
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,287
What?

671
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,916
- Who told you that?
- I had your baby.

672
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:09,585
That's why I know.

673
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:13,631
And if what happened yesterday
were real...

674
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:19,220
But you aren't going to make me happy,

675
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,098
and I won't make you happy either.

676
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,310
It's best you don't see me again.

677
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,166
Carlos, the keys to the Shadow.

678
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,879
They're in the other pocket.

679
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:04,515
Let's go.

680
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,359
Charlie.

681
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:20,031
This might not be the right moment
to tell you this, but...

682
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,325
I got Maradona.

683
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:29,539
- The seatbelt doesn't work.
- It never did, remember?

684
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,918
I don't remember.
I never wore it back then.

685
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:38,758
Would you have shot me?

686
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,260
What do you think?

687
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,430
You seemed very sure.

688
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,975
- It's clear you're dying for a new life.
- Aren't you?

689
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,396
Enough to kill someone? I don't know.

690
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,774
Are you sure I was going to shoot?

691
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,445
What a criminal record we have now.

692
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,615
Armed robbery, stealing his car,
stealing his wallet.

693
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,242
Technically, we didn't steal anything
from anyone,

694
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,496
because we're driving my car,
it's my wallet, and the ticket's in it.

695
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:12,500
Sure, tell that to the judge, Mr. Lawyer.

696
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,756
What did you tell him
so he'd give you the ticket?

697
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:26,012
Something that only the two of us know.

698
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,225
Wow. That was something
between you and me, wasn't it?

699
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,229
Well, technically it's still between
you and me, isn't it?

700
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,275
- What?
- No, nothing.

701
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:40,444
That smile.

702
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:46,951
It's been a while since
I've seen you smile, and you look nice.

703
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:56,960
- Carlos.
- What?

704
00:54:56,961 --> 00:55:00,338
- Look, my ring's gone.
- Did you drop it?

705
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:03,968
No, it's disappeared, I haven't even
got the mark on my finger...

706
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,019
Carlos!

707
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:17,148
- We did it.
- We did.

708
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,486
I won't go to the concert,
and we'll never see each other again.

709
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:28,534
- And... we'll both have different fates.
- Yes.

710
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,661
Different.

711
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,002
Should we celebrate?

712
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:46,509
Do you remember how this car sounded?

713
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:52,557
I think... I was never in this car.

714
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,018
Of course you were, this was where...

715
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:59,106
No, not anymore. I was never in this car.

716
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,973
{\an8}ELENA AND THE SKATES
GET GOLDEN RECORD!

717
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:54,949
- Your hair!
- What?

718
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:59,078
What did I do to my hair?

719
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:04,917
Carlos, are you wearing hair oil?

720
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:09,463
Damn. Gel.

721
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,384
So much gel.

722
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,305
I'm the wannabe Prince Charles.

723
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:22,977
I'm practically a mural.

724
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:27,356
Fuck, where's my chest hair?

725
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:30,734
Carlos.

726
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,365
I'm not wearing a seatbelt
and... I don't care.

727
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,295
I need a cigarette.

728
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,380
- You smoke?
- Yes, lots of things.

729
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:53,715
I need a drink.

730
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:55,801
- You drink?
- Constantly.

731
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,394
We did it.

732
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,444
We're going to... forget each other.

733
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:20,993
I think this...

734
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:23,996
is over.

735
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:29,960
Elena, hey.

736
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,505
When I said "different"...

737
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:40,971
I meant passionate, brave, joyful,
that's what I saw in you.

738
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,143
I saw fire in your eyes
and I fell in love.

739
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,104
Now that was a proper compliment.

740
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:54,776
A little late, but thank you anyway.

741
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:57,112
I saw you on that stage singing,

742
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,531
and there was that fire in your eyes.

743
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:01,950
And you know what?

744
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,622
It's too much for me.
I don't know how to handle it.

745
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:15,172
Carlitos, our son, knew how
to bring out that look.

746
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,555
He was the soundtrack to our story.

747
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,560
Without music, there's not much
of a story to tell.

748
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:42,241
It's all right, we're going to be okay.

749
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:44,993
Right?

750
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:49,748
Elena.

751
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,862
Elena? Elena!

752
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:21,864
Elena!

753
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,719
<i>57702... 54...</i>

754
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:49,850
61... All right.
I remembered my parents' number.

755
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,561
Mini-me, pick up, please, pick up.

756
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:56,648
<i>Hello?</i>

757
01:02:58,317 --> 01:02:59,775
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mom?

758
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,068
<i>It can't be.</i>

759
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,404
<i>Who is this?</i>

760
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:05,324
<i>Carlitos? Honey, is it you?</i>

761
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:10,119
No, sorry. I'm a... policeman.

762
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,831
We found your son's car. I wanted
to know if he could tell us anything.

763
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:18,337
<i>Officer. Carlitos isn't here,
but it was a scary situation.</i>

764
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,464
<i>You can imagine.</i>

765
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:48,699
Maybe your son could help us
with the investigation.

766
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:54,498
<i>Sure, if you want to give me your details,
I'll ask him to call you when he's back.</i>

767
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,875
<i>Would that be okay?</i>

768
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:00,753
No, I don't know. Do you want to talk...

769
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:05,801
<i>Thank you, Officer, but no. I mean,
I'm terrified, he's my son. Are you a dad?</i>

770
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,687
Let's see...

771
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,857
Of course. I made it.

772
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,068
Before the concert.

773
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:18,498
I was a dad too, I had a son.

774
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:23,544
And, well, there was a car accident.

775
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:24,838
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

776
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,552
And I lost him.

777
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:46,610
No! No, no, no!

778
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,864
Where are you? Where are you?

779
01:05:56,495 --> 01:06:00,332
What... What have we done?

780
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:08,298
And, well, now he's gone.

781
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,177
- He'll never exist.
- <i>I'm so sorry, Officer.</i>

782
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,180
<i>He'll live forever in your heart.</i>

783
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:21,269
No, he won't. He won't exist. We decided.

784
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:36,784
He had... light hair.

785
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:39,663
He had brown hair. Brown hair.

786
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,499
Deep eyes.

787
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:47,754
He was 1.30 meters high...

788
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,718
<i>Children are like
the soundtrack to our story.</i>

789
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:58,098
<i>When the soundtrack to our story ends,</i>
kaputt, finito, <i>okay?</i>

790
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:11,319
<i>Have you ever looked into someone's eyes
and immediately saw their soul?</i>

791
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,492
<i>It's not just a concert,
it's seeing her again.</i>

792
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,788
The last song.

793
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:31,715
One last song... one last song.

794
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,805
Hi, it's Carlos.

795
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,277
Thanks.

796
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,237
No, thank you.

797
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:05,623
Hats! Maná hats!

798
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:07,417
Hats! Get a Maná hat!

799
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,253
- Thanks.
- Maná hats!

800
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,799
Get a Maná hat!

801
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,259
How much?

802
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,388
Hi, Cristi.

803
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,690
Well, come in,
my grandma wants to meet you.

804
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,333
This guy?

805
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:51,962
What's up?

806
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:06,810
- No, don't torture me, please!
- Javier!

807
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:09,604
Hey.

808
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:19,363
How do you know my name?

809
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,950
- No one knows my name.
- But I do.

810
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,079
I know this is very weird.

811
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:30,709
But I'm Carlos. Your best friend.

812
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:34,296
What did you do to your hair?

813
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:40,801
Gel, and a lot of it but, hey,

814
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:44,764
I can tell you all about
Miguel Mejía Barón's lineup.

815
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,643
A ton of information
about the future of football.

816
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:52,647
Like what?

817
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,568
I can tell you who wins the World Cup.

818
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,779
Okay, and what do I have to do?

819
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,867
Get your wingman to the concert
before it ends. That's all.

820
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:09,289
- But we'll never get there in that.
- We will on your Ninja.

821
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,960
I don't know how to drive my bike.

822
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,714
But I do.

823
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,855
- Miguel Herrera doesn't go?
- No, and it gets worse.

824
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,316
Hugo Sánchez doesn't play
in the decisive match.

825
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:39,068
- And you know who misses a penalty?
- Who?

826
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,278
Roberto Baggio.

827
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:05,511
With all the mess the Zapatistas
have made, we need someone like Colosio.

828
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:06,638
Yes, of course.

829
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,101
And you? Who will you vote for?

830
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:16,731
Me? I don't know yet.

831
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,904
Sweetie, there's not really
a decision to make.

832
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:50,180
- Right. We're here.
- Okay.

833
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:53,017
- Now what?
- You get him out of there.

834
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:56,687
You give him this ticket
and tell him to go to the concert.

835
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:59,274
- Me?
- Who else?

836
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:04,404
The psycho who stole his car and ticket
and fucked up his life out of fear?

837
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:06,489
Chickless.

838
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:11,286
You're his best friend. His wingman.

839
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,830
Okay, I'll do it.

840
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,957
- You will?
- Yeah.

841
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,752
- Right...
- Chickless!

842
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:22,005
Okay.

843
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:30,096
You're our only hope, okay?

844
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:33,725
Okay!

845
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,522
Go for it!

846
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,279
Go on!

847
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:54,704
Carlos.

848
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:59,333
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

849
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:00,960
I got confused, sorry.

850
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:09,719
The best choice, honey. Delicious!

851
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,944
Oh, baby.

852
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,951
- Chickless?
- What?

853
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:39,833
- How disgusting, Cristina! Not here.
- What's wrong with you two?

854
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,336
Daddy, relax. I'm...

855
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,714
Chickless? What's he doing here?

856
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:50,217
- Is it the gardener?
- What's wrong with your friend?

857
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:52,302
- Your friend?
- Charlie!

858
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:55,849
I got your ticket back!
Come on, there's still a chance.

859
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,190
What's happening?

860
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:12,699
- He's running towards the glass window.
- The dumbass will...

861
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,952
My window!

862
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,675
What's that?

863
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:34,011
- It's my ticket.
- I'm going to call the police.

864
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:39,142
Your ticket, Charlie.
I'm hope. I got it back.

865
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:43,396
What are you doing in my house
and who the hell are you?

866
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,398
He's Chickless.

867
01:14:47,442 --> 01:14:48,693
He's my wingman.

868
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:53,114
- And he's here for me.
- Charlie, what's going on?

869
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:59,412
If you take that ticket, we're through.

870
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,165
My love...

871
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,092
Carlos, come back here!

872
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,470
How are you?

873
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,183
Charlie, who knows you better than me?
Who?

874
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,062
Even you don't know yourself better
than I do.

875
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:28,524
I've never seen you like that over a girl.
Don't fuck it up.

876
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:32,153
Chickless, we won't make it.

877
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:38,785
Yes, we will.

878
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:41,495
You again?

879
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,455
Hell no, I'm not going with that madman.

880
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,458
I thought I was the only one
who knew how to ride that bike.

881
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:49,671
Exactly. Only you know how.

882
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:52,172
I know this sounds crazy,

883
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:54,425
but I promise if you don't
get on this bike,

884
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,511
this is the future in store for you.

885
01:15:57,512 --> 01:16:00,640
Wearing an ascot, slicked back hair,
living in daddy's bubble.

886
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,350
Come on!

887
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:03,893
Go ahead.

888
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,596
Ticket?

889
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,313
<i>Sun coming up</i>

890
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:34,776
<i>Coming up for you</i>

891
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:40,113
<i>This regret hurts</i>

892
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:43,284
<i>It burns without your love</i>

893
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:51,750
<i>You haven't called me
I'm desperate</i>

894
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:53,252
The last song.

895
01:17:54,879 --> 01:18:00,843
<i>I've cried for you for many moons</i>

896
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:02,678
Come on!

897
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,765
<i>Sun coming up</i>

898
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:32,875
- We did it.
- Yes.

899
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:34,293
Hey.

900
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:39,506
Don't fuck it up.
This is like a second chance.

901
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:40,591
Yes.

902
01:18:43,094 --> 01:18:44,178
Any advice?

903
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:51,184
- Yes. Don't chew ice.
- But she said it was cool.

904
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:54,980
No, forget it. She hates it.
Don't chew ice. Okay?

905
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,982
- Okay.
- Say goodbye to that habit forever.

906
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:57,983
Okay.

907
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,193
One thing.

908
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:05,116
When you see Mom,
give her a big kiss from both of us?

909
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:06,616
Okay.

910
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,286
And every time you get in the car,
use the seatbelt.

911
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,165
Get in the car, seatbelt, always.

912
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,250
- Okay?
- Yes.

913
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,127
Carlos.

914
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,713
Good luck.

915
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:24,844
- Ticket?
- Yeah.

916
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:30,349
- It has to be here.
- What happened?

917
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:37,189
- In that tiny pocket.
- No, no, no!

918
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,815
I can't find the ticket.

919
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:40,067
Oh, shit!

920
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:42,069
You dropped it.

921
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:46,949
Now go and kiss me
before the last song's over.

922
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,704
- You?
- No, silly! Not me, the other me! Go!

923
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,790
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

924
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,417
Good luck!

925
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:05,593
Hi.

926
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:11,766
That... damn smile again.

927
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,481
That... damn look again.

928
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:29,158
<i>Sun coming up</i>

929
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:33,788

930
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:41,587

01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:51,138

<i>The sun</i>

<i>I miss you</i>

939
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:31,970
I want to change.

01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:35,890
<i>I love you</i>

941
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,184
<i>I love you more</i>

942
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:41,856
I feel like I was only thinking about me,
and I'd forgotten about you.

<i>I miss you</i>

946
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:50,822
I thought you weren't coming.

947
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,867
And miss out on my future with you? Never.

948
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:56,077
I want you to do concerts, make music,

949
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,038
fill stadiums, that people...

950
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:59,540
You talk too much.

951
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:21,479
That's beautiful.

952
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:27,817
- When...
- Miss me?

953
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:31,696
- Damn, you could've warned us!
- Charlie, love is always unexpected.

954
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:35,201
- Yes, but it's not this scary.
- It can be.

955
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:37,953
What now?

956
01:22:41,374 --> 01:22:42,375
Listen...

957
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:11,320
So fucking beautiful.

958
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:13,656
Let's go.

959
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:24,499
- What happened?
- What happened?

960
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,127
- I don't know what happened.
- We were...

961
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:28,212
Asleep.

962
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:32,967
My clothes.

963
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,346
What happened?

964
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:43,018
My hair.

965
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:45,771
My hair.

966
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:50,067
My tattoos are gone.

967
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:53,529
Was it a dream?

968
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:58,284
- What's going on?
- Look.

969
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:34,987
THE SKATES

970
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:40,993
Elena.

971
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,709
I didn't finish signing.

972
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,214
I don't want you to.

973
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:56,258
Me neither.

974
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:06,018
Mom! Dad! Come!

975
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,596
Look what I found!

976
01:25:54,441 --> 01:26:00,447
{\an8}With You in the Future

977
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,326
Careful.

978
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,580
What do we have here?

979
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:14,128
First, I jumped a two-meter high fence.

980
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:19,466
Then... a dog, a rabid dog chased me.

981
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:23,803
And then, I smashed through a window,

982
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:26,473
there was smoke, glass...

983
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:28,767
Why on earth would you do that?

984
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:33,647
Well...

985
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,526
My friend's future depended on it.

986
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,656
So you're not crazy, you're a hero.

987
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,869
<i>Love is the soundtrack to our story.</i>

988
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:53,334
<i>As long as you want to listen to it,
it doesn't just play on, it evolves.</i>
