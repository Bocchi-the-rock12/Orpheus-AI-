00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,772
'Cause I was thinking,

380
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,475
that we should start
looking for a new apartment.

381
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,412
What? Our place is fine.

382
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,382
And I still have some
credit card debt left.

383

Yeah, sure.

417
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:24,802

Man... as much as I would love that,

439
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,093
that's a no-can-fucking-do.

440
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,062
What?

441
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,098

-[Betty] Watch the curb.
-[Danny] Where?

475
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,021
[Betty] Watch the curb!

I'm okay.

480
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,295
Thanks for the water and stuff.

481
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,831
Do you want some eggs?

482
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,401
No, I'm not hungry.

483
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,737
Are you sure? I can make
you uh, like a sandwich.

484
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:35,906
No, I'm okay.

485
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,276

493
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,588
from CITC Visa.

494
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,891

500
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:17,407
[Danny] Listen, I think my bar tending
skills absolutely translate to sales.

501
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,845
[interviewer] Do you have
any product sales experience?

502
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,113
Like retail?

503
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,482
No, but...

504
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:31,822
I'm a very good communicator
and... a fast learner.

505
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,461
[water rustling]

506
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,244

507
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,420
[Danny] Hey Mom.

508
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,858
You need your car today?

509
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,495
I'm at the Bluffs.

510
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,868
Oh, oh, okay. Okay, I'm coming.

511
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,370
Shit, that's today.

512
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,015
[engine revs]

513
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,275
[car door closes]

514
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,044
[sales woman] If you really
just moisturize it and dab it,

515
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,280
on your forehead. Yes, under the eyes.

516
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,982
Yes, any problem areas you might have.

517
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,383
-[guest] You see this?
-Oh, yes.

518
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,752
And it's not greasy, do you feel that?

519
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,387
-I need this.
-Oh, yes.

520
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,055
-Yes, yes.
-Some cream right there.

521
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,590
Oh, yes and then you just dab it.

522
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,592
[sales woman] The
technique of this, is dabbing.

523
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,930
Because this, this finger doesn't
have many muscles in it. It's very weak...

524
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,566
Did you get to, to try
our body, our body line?

525
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,244
-[guest] No.
-[sales woman] Oh my goodness,

526
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:27,804
you didn't try our body
line yet? Oh my gosh.

527
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,840
Yes, if you take a look at our package.

528
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:33,710
Yeah, the packaging is
actually, is actually all recycled.

529
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:38,415
Yeah, we use recycled plastic. We're all
about natural. Yeah, touch it, feel it, yeah!

530
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,126
[sales woman] But ladies,
I have some good news,

531
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,561
I just wanted to tell you, -[guest] Okay.

532
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,421
Our kits right now are
two for the price of one.

533
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:49,293
So you get two bottles
of the serum for $79.99.

534

01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,042
That's weird.

740
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,745
Well, why were they closed?

741
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:23,980
