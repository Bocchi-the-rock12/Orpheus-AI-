  {
    "Input": "How does a rocket work?",
    "Output": "Simply put, when the rocket engine is ignited, physical and chemical reactions occur inside the engine. These reactions generate an upward force. According to Newton's laws, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so a downward force is also generated. If that upward force is greater than our gravitational pull (g = 9.81 m/s²), then the rocket will fly upwards."
  },
  {
    "Input": "What is gravity?",
    "Output": "In simple terms, gravity is a force generated by the attraction between masses. It exists in every object with mass in our universe, and it's what allows us to exist."
  },
  {
    "Input": "Explain me integrals",
    "Output": "Integration is a mathematical operation—specifically, the inverse of differentiation. Integrating a function means finding a family of functions whose derivative is that function. Geometrically, it represents the area under a curve."
  },
  {
    "Input": "Explain me derivatives",
    "Output": "Derivatives are a mathematical operation that measures the rate of change of a given function. They allow mathematicians to determine how a function's value changes as its variable changes. Geometrically, a derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph."

  },
  {
    "Input": "What is the photoelectric effect?",
    "Output": "The photoelectric effect is a physical phenomenon discovered by Albert Einstein. It occurs when a metal releases electrons upon being struck by electromagnetic waves, and it is widely used in technology."
  },
  {
    "Input": "What is an electromagnetic wave?",
    "Output": "An electromagnetic wave is a self-sustaining oscillation of electric and magnetic fields that travels through space at the speed of light. It doesn't require a medium to propagate, and its spectrum ranges from radio waves to gamma rays, each carrying different energy levels."

  {
    "Input": "What color are giraffe tongues?",
