    - text: "In simple terms, gravity is a force generated by the attraction between masses. It exists in every object with mass in our universe, and it's what allows us to exist."
    - text: "Integration is a mathematical operation—specifically, the inverse of differentiation. Integrating a function means finding a family of functions whose derivative is that function. Geometrically, it represents the area under a curve."
    - text: "Derivatives are a mathematical operation that measures the rate of change of a given function. They allow mathematicians to determine how a function's value changes as its variable changes. Geometrically, a derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph."
    - text: "A black hole is a region of spacetime that is so massive and dense that nothing can escape it—not even light."

    - text: "Sure, the probabilities for what?"
    - text: "The history of mathematics dates back to ancient times, with early civilizations like the Egyptians and Babylonians developing mathematical concepts such as arithmetic and geometry. Greek mathematics, with figures like Pythagoras, Euclid, and Archimedes, established many fundamental principles. During the Middle Ages, mathematics was preserved and expanded by Arab scholars. The Renaissance brought significant advancements, and figures like Newton and Leibniz founded calculus. In the 20th century, new fields such as set theory and abstract algebra emerged."
    - text: "Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part. They were developed to solve equations that had no solutions in the set of real numbers, such as x^2 + 1 = 0.
