  utter_ask_physics:
    - text: "In simple terms, gravity is a force generated by the attraction between masses. It exists in every object with mass in our universe, and it's what allows us to exist."
    - text: "The theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, includes two parts: special relativity, which deals with objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass."
    - text: "The photoelectric effect is a physical phenomenon discovered by Albert Einstein. It occurs when a metal releases electrons upon being struck by electromagnetic waves, and it is widely used in technology."
    - text: "An electromagnetic wave is a self-sustaining oscillation of electric and magnetic fields that travels through space at the speed of light. It doesn't require a medium to propagate, and its spectrum ranges from radio waves to gamma rays, each carrying different energy levels."
    - text: "Simply put, when the rocket engine is ignited, physical and chemical reactions occur inside the engine. These reactions generate an upward force. According to Newton's laws, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so a downward force is also generated. If that upward force is greater than our gravitational pull (g = 9.81 m/s²), then the rocket will fly upwards."
    - text: "A black hole is a region of spacetime that is so massive and dense that nothing can escape it—not even light."
    - text: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy, typically from the Sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose. It involves chlorophyll and the absorption of carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen."
  
  utter_ask_mathematics:
    - text: "Integration is a mathematical operation—specifically, the inverse of differentiation. Integrating a function means finding a family of functions whose derivative is that function. Geometrically, it represents the area under a curve."
    - text: "Derivatives are a mathematical operation that measures the rate of change of a given function. They allow mathematicians to determine how a function's value changes as its variable changes. Geometrically, a derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph."
    - text: "The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, stating that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides."
    - text: "The Zeta Riemann function is a function of complex argument. It takes any complex argument and calculates the sum from 1 to infinity of 1/n^s. It's one of the most known functions in the world, with its zeroes still being a mystery in the world of mathematics."
    - text: "A Riemann integral is an integral of a function that is well defined within the interval of integration. An improper integral is when you try to integrate a function that tends to infinity within the interval. For example, integrating 1/x over [1, 0] causes the function to approach infinity as x approaches 0."
    - text: "Yes, sure! Do you know about elemental operations with matrices?"
    - text: "Definitely Carl Friedrich Gauss, he was one of the most brilliant mathematicians and physicists to ever exist!"
    - text: "The 'aperto de mão' theorem, or 'Handshaking Lemma', states that in any graph, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices is twice the number of edges. This is because each edge contributes exactly 2 to the total degree—one for each vertex it connects."
    - text: "Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics that deals with discrete objects like integers, graphs, and combinatorics, as opposed to continuous objects like real numbers."
