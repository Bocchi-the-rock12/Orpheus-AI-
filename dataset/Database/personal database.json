    "Output": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two main parts: Special Relativity (1905):  - Deals with objects moving at constant speeds, like near the speed of light.   - Says that time and space are relative—meaning they change depending on speed.   - Introduces time dilation (time slows down for fast-moving objects) and length contraction (objects appear shorter when moving fast).   - Famous equation: E = mc² (energy and mass are interchangeable). General Relativity (1915):   - Explains gravity as the bending of space and time by massive objects.   - Predicts things like black holes, gravitational time dilation, and the expansion of the universe."
